@article{Blasco2002,
abstract = {The purpose of this work is to present a non-chemical weed controller for vegetable crops derived from a cooperative French-Spanish project. One of the major efforts of this project is related with working in a natural, complex environment and the similarity between the weeds and the vegetable crop, which makes locating the weeds difficult. The robotic arm presents a parallel structure with six degrees of freedom, and due to its light structure, it is capable of reaching high accelerations. The end-effector has an electrode powered by a set of batteries and kills the weeds by producing an electrical discharge of 15 000 V. All the subsystems of the machine communicate through a controller area network (CAN) bus. There are two vision systems mounted on the machine. The first one is placed at the front of the robot to acquire and analyse field images, in order to detect weeds and send their coordinates to the robotic arm control. The second camera is placed close to the electrode, and its mission is to correct inertial perturbations by relocating every individual weed detected by the first vision system. The successful performance of this new concept of precise non-chemical weeding has been demonstrated in a lettuce crop in Valencia, Spain. (C) 2001 Silsoe Research Institute.},

@article{Cheng2017,
abstract = {(1) Background: Since early yield prediction is relevant for resource requirements of harvesting and marketing in the whole fruit industry, this paper presents a new approach of using image analysis and tree canopy features to predict early yield with artificial neural networks (ANN); (2) Methods: Two back propagation neural network (BPNN) models were developed for the early period after natural fruit drop in June and the ripening period, respectively. Within the same periods, images of apple cv. “Gala” trees were captured from an orchard near Bonn, Germany. Two sample sets were developed to train and test models; each set included 150 samples from the 2009 and 2010 growing season. For each sample (each canopy image), pixels were segmented into fruit, foliage, and background using image segmentation. The four features extracted from the data set for the canopy were: total cross-sectional area of fruits, fruit number, total cross-section area of small fruits, and cross-sectional area of foliage, and were used as inputs. With the actual weighted yield per tree as a target, BPNN was employed to learn their mutual relationship as a prerequisite to develop the prediction; (3) Results: For the developed BPNN model of the early period after June drop, correlation coefficients (R2) between the estimated and the actual weighted yield, mean forecast error (MFE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.81, −0.05, 10.7{\%}, 2.34 kg/tree, respectively. For the model of the ripening period, these measures were 0.83, −0.03, 8.9{\%}, 2.3 kg/tree, respectively. In 2011, the two previously developed models were used to predict apple yield. The RMSE and R2 values between the estimated and harvested apple yield were 2.6 kg/tree and 0.62 for the early period (small, green fruit) and improved near harvest (red, large fruit) to 2.5 kg/tree and 0.75 for a tree with ca. 18 kg yield per tree. For further method verification, the cv. “Pinova” apple trees were used as another variety in 2012 to develop the BPNN prediction model for the early period after June drop. The model was used in 2013, which gave similar results as those found with cv. “Gala”; (4) Conclusion: Overall, the results showed in this research that the proposed estimation models performed accurately using canopy and fruit features using image analysis algorithms.},

@article{Pedersen2006,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the economic feasibility of applying autonomous robotic vehicles compared to conventional systems in three different applications: robotic weeding in high value crops (particularly sugar beet), crop scouting in cereals and grass cutting on golf courses. The comparison was based on a systems analysis and an individual economic feasibility study for each of the three applications. The results showed that in all three scenarios, the robotic applications are more economically feasible than the conventional systems. The high cost of real time kinematics Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and the small capacity of the vehicles are the main parameters that increase the cost of the robotic systems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Much research on automation in agriculture has been presented in recent years at the annual meetings of the Japanese Society of Agricultural Machinery (JSAM). This research has been performed in universities and government institutes, and by agricultural machinery manufacturers. Because of funding limitations, research in universities has concentrated on methodologies, such as navigation, sensing, and application of control theory. Development of a one dimensional image sensor, and application of neural networks and genetic algorithms, has taken place at Hokkaido University; vision guidance and fuzzy logic application at the University of Tokyo; an automatic follow-up vehicle has been developed at Kyoto University; and an automatic transport vehicle at Ehime University. At research institutes and manufacturers, with their greater financial freedom, more practical systems have been developed. A tilling robot and a driver-less air blast sprayer is being developed in the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institute (BRAIN); and an autonomous rice planter, a tillage robot and autonomous forage tractor in the research institute of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery (MAFF). Kubota Co. Ltd has developed autonomous rice planting and husbandry vehicles. In Asian countries an autonomous speed sprayer is under study in Korea and an autonomous power sprayer in Taiwan, but little research is performed elsewhere in Asia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {This work details the development and validation of an algorithm for estimating the number of apples in color images acquired in orchards under natural illumination. Ultimately, this algorithm is intended to enable estimation of the orchard yield and be part of a management decision support system. The algorithm includes four main steps: detection of pixels that have a high probability of belonging to apples, using color and smoothness; formation and extension of "seed areas", which are connected sets of pixels that have a high probability of belonging to apples; segmentation of the contours of these seed areas into arcs and amorphous segments; and combination of these arcs and comparison of the resulting circle with a simple model of an apple. The performance of the algorithm is investigated using two datasets. The first dataset consists of images recorded in full automatic mode of the camera and under various lighting conditions. Although the algorithm detects correctly more than 85{\%} of the apples visible in the images, direct illumination and color saturation cause a large number of false positive detections. The second dataset consists of images that were manually underexposed and recorded under mostly diffusive light (close to sunset). For such images the correct detection rate is close to 95{\%} while the false positive detection rate is less than 5{\%}. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks and operations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widely demonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructured environments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, developments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, structures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performance measures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital for comparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisation and assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and to each task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic environments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low action success rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated into multi-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rate increased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems will enable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on each of these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Research needs to focus on the field use of autonomous or human–robot systems, the latter being a reasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should be suited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.},

abstract = {Two methods for estimating the yield of different crops in Hungary from satellite remote sensing data are presented. The steps of preprocessing the remote sensing data (for geometric, radiometric, atmospheric and cloud scattering correction) are described. In the first method developed for field level estimation, reference crop fields were selected by using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for classification. A new vegetation index (General Yield Unified Reference Index (GYURI)) was deduced using a fitted double-Gaussian curve to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data during the vegetation period. The correlation between GYURI and the field level yield data for corn for three years was R2=0.75. The county-average yield data showed higher correlation significant distortion from the model gave information of the possible stress of the field. The second method presented uses only NOAA AVHRR and officially reported county-level yield data. The county-level yield data and the deduced vegetation index, GYURRI, were investigated for eight different crops for eight years. The obtained correlation was high The developed robust method proved to be stable and accurate for operational use for county-, region- and country-level yield estimation. The method is simple and inexpensive for application in developing countries, too.},

@article{Tillett1998,
abstract = {The object of the work was to demonstrate individual spot treatment with spray of transplanted cauliflower from a small vehicle that could operate autonomously within a field. The only prior information required was to be the plant spacing, an approximate row length and the number of beds. To achieve this a small horticultural toolframe tractor was fitted with navigation and computer control equipment and an experimental marking device. A charged couple device (CCD) was located centrally at the front of the vehicle looking forward and down in order to provide images of crop rows. The images were analysed to provide guidance information. Signals from vehicle motion sensors (odometry and accelerometers) and a compass were combined with the image analysis data to provide vehicle control information that was robust to natural variability. A segmentation was performed using image intensity, size and geometric information to pick out crop plants requiring treatment. This information was passed to the treatment device controller which selected from an array of 27 solenoid valves to operate appropriate spray nozzles arranged transversely across the machine. Field trials of selective spray treatment of a young transplanted crop, conducted at a vehicle speed of 0{\textperiodcentered}7 m/s, showed that all plants were treated, though coverage of each plant was not perfect. Mean measured error along the row was 1 mm and lateral error 11 mm. The standard deviation in these errors were 26 and 20 mm, respectively. Only 8{\%} of the total area of the bed was covered with spray, thus showing a potentially large saving in agro-chemicals with environmental and economic advantages. The vehicle has been operated extensively in a wide variety of crops of different sizes and ground coverage, with good reliability under favourable lighting conditions.},

abstract = {The advanced electronic technology makes the mobile phone suitable for citrus yield estimation with image processing techniques. This article proposes a new method to estimate the yield of citrus two weeks ahead of the harvesting season for an individual tree via image processing using an Android mobile phone (AMP). The procedure is essentially fruit-counting algorithm software developed in Java that uses AMP touch panel monitor to estimate citrus yield. The target photos were taken in natural conditions by the AMP. The image processing was used to choose colour, segment image, generate binarisation image, remove noise, and estimate fruit number. A modified 8-connectedness chain code to estimate the number of clustered citrus was introduced. The performance of the fruit-counting algorithm software was validated with 40 samples of citrus trees and the method achieved good precision and recognition ratio of 90{\%}. The results indicated that the approach could be utilised to estimate the fruit yield of an individual tree which is valuable information to forecast yields, plan harvest schedules and generate prescription maps for site-specific management practices on an individual tree basis within the grove. Aided by the proposed approach, one can estimate the citrus yield without expensive equipment. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAgrE.},

The objectives of this study were (i) to study the flower density variability in an apple orchard using image analysis and (ii) to model the correlation between flower density as determined from image analysis and fruit yield. The research was carried out in a commercial apple orchard in Central Greece. In April 2007, when the trees were at full bloom, photos of the trees were taken following a systematic uniform random sampling procedure. In September 2007, yield mapping was carried out measuring yield per ten trees and recording the position of the centre of the ten trees. Using this data (the measured yield of the trees and the pictures samples, representing the flower distribution), an image processing-based algorithm was developed that predicts tree yield by analyzing the picture of the tree at full bloom. For the evaluation of the algorithm, a case study scenario is presented where the error of the predicted yield was set at 18{\%}. These results indicated that potential yield could be predicted early in the season from flowering distribution maps and could be used for orchard management during the growing season. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

A retrospective study and predictive study is presented, for 1986-1988 and 1989 respectively, for an area in Northern Greece. Results are encouraging for operational crop monitoring. Yield for wheat, cotton, rice and maize crops has been estimated to a high degree of accuracy using a simple linear relationship between NDVI and yield. However input from an agro-meteorological model is recommended to modify the model during the grain-filling period of the wheat crop. The estimates stabilize 50-100 days prior to harvest enabling an early assessment of crop yield to be made.},

abstract = {A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) was developed for autonomous operation of a speed sprayer in an orchard. The operation of the FLC was graphically simulated under the real condition of the orchard. Machine vision was used to determine vehicle heading and four ultrasonic sensors were used to detect obstacles during the operation. Operation time duration of the hydraulic cylinders was inferred as output of the FLC. The results of simulation showed that the speed sprayer could be operated autonomously by the FLC that used sensor inputs from machine vision and ultrasonic sensors. After the graphic simulation, autonomous speed sprayer operation in a real orchard was conducted using the developed FLC. Orchard image analysis and signals of ultrasonic sensors were processed in real time. The speed sprayer was modified to be steered by two hydraulic cylinders. The results of field test showed that the speed sprayer could be operated by the FLC. The ultrasonic sensors didn't contribute to the improvement of guidance performance; however, they assisted the speed sprayer to avoid trees or obstacles in emergent situations.},

The comparison was based on a systems analysis and an individual economic feasibility study for each of the three applications. The results showed that in all three scenarios, the robotic applications are more economically feasible than the conventional systems. The high cost of real time kinematics Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and the small capacity of the vehicles are the main parameters that increase the cost of the robotic systems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Work on water stress detection at tree and orchard levels using a high-spatial airborne thermal sensor is presented, showing its connection with yield and some fruit quality indicators in olive and peach commercial orchards under different irrigation regimes. Two airborne campaigns were conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over olive and peach orchards located in C{\'{o}}rdoba, southern Spain. The AHS sensor was flown at three different times on 25 July 2004 and 16 July 2005, collecting 2 m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 $\mu$m spectral range. Thermal bands were assessed for the retrieval of land surface temperature using the split-window algorithm and TES (Temperature-Emissivity-Separation) method, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels using the reflectance bands. Stem water potential and stomatal conductance were measured on selected trees at the time of airborne flights over the orchards. Tree fruit yield and quality parameters such as oil, weight and water content (for the olive trees), and fruit volume and weight (for the peach trees) were obtained at harvest and through laboratory analysis. Relationships between airborne-estimated crown temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r2 = 0.5 (12:30 GMT) at the olive tree level, and r2 = 0.81 (9:00 GMT) at the treatment level in peach trees. These results demonstrate that water stress can be detected at the crown level even under the usual water management conditions of commercial orchards. Regressions of yield and fruit quality against remote sensing estimates of crown temperature as an indicator of water stress, yielded r2 = 0.95 (olive fruit water content) and r2 = 0.94 (peach fruit mean diameter). These results suggest that high-spatial remote sensing thermal imagery has potential as an indicator of some fruit quality parameters for crop field segmentation and irrigation management purposes. A simulation study using ASTER spectral bands and aggregated pixels for stress detection as a function of irrigation level was conducted in order to study the applicability of medium resolution thermal sensors for the global monitoring of open-canopy tree crops. The determination coefficients obtained between the ASTER-simulated canopy temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r2 = 0.58 (12:30 GMT) for olive trees, suggesting the potential for extrapolating these methods to ASTER satellite for global monitoring of open tree canopies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Numerous efforts have been made to develop various indices using remote sensing data such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) for mapping and monitoring of drought and assessment of vegetation health and productivity. NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall are valuable sources of information for the estimation and prediction of crop conditions. In the present paper, we have considered NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall data of Iowa state, US, for 19 years for crop yield assessment and prediction using piecewise linear regression method with breakpoint. Crop production environment consists of inherent sources of heterogeneity and their non-linear behavior. A non-linear Quasi-Newton multi-variate optimization method is utilized, which reasonably minimizes inconsistency and errors in yield prediction. Minimization of least square loss function has been carried out through iterative convergence using pre-defined empirical equation that provided acceptable lower residual values with predicted values very close to observed ones (R2 = 0.78) for Corn and Soybean crop (R2 = 0.86) for Iowa state. The crop yield prediction model discussed in the present paper will further improve in future with the use of long period dataset. Similar model can be developed for different crops of other locations. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The electrical layout of the prototype vehicle containing the necessary navigation and control equipment is described. A four layer control system architecture is presented containing the steering and motion control, path execution, perception and planning/reasoning. To evaluate the control system of the prototype vehicle a path consisting of straight lines and left/right turns was constructed. The vehicle was able to follow this path with an error less than 0.3 m in turns and less than 0.2 m following straight lines. The prototype vehicle was constructed in a half year to gain experience with the control and navigation system; using these experiences a new prototype vehicle is under construction. The guidelines for the construction of the new vehicle are described.},

Experiments to establish accuracy are described. These were carried out on four plots of cauliflowers with varying degrees of disruption to the visual scene. The RMS error of vehicle lateral position control was 2- mm, while the RMS error of estimated vehicle position was about 10 mm. Little effect of the disruption on position control was observed. It is concluded that these accuracies would be sufficient to control a vehicle and an associated crop treatment device but that improvements to the vehicle controller would make the control of the treatment device easier.},

abstract = {This review investigates the research effort, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, and the associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps. Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and reliable???human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and highly dynamic situation.},

abstract = {Tree canopy mapping with an automated ultrasonic system is inexpensive, fairly straightforward and could be used to estimate fruit yield within a grove to plan site-specific management practices. Tree canopy volumes and fruit yield were measured and mapped in a 17.0-ha 'Valencia' grove with an automated ultrasonic system and a sensor-based automatic yield monitoring system, respectively. The spatial data were divided into 40 equal sized plots using ArcView GIS software to relate tree sizes and fruit yield. A linear calibration model with half the data showed that ultrasonically-sensed tree sizes correlated significantly (R2 = 0.80) with fruit yield. The correlation between actual and predicted fruit yield with the remaining data was used for validation and was also significant (R2 = 0.42). The average prediction accuracy was 90.6{\%} while the standard error of prediction and root mean square error were 4.25 and 4.16 Mg/ha, respectively. The ultrasonically-sensed tree canopy volumes of plots ranged from 7421 to 20,900 m3/ha; fruit yield within the grove was also variable, ranging from 21 to 45 Mg/ha. Tree size and yield maps produced similar spatial patterns within the grove, as high-yielding areas were associated with large tree canopies. Therefore, tree canopy size could be used to estimate fruit yield within the grove. This information is valuable to forecast yields, to plan harvest schedules and to generate prescription maps for site-specific management practices on an individual tree basis. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

This vision system controls a weeding-tool that removes the weed within the row of crops. The row-recognition system is based on a novel algorithm and has been tested extensively in outdoor field tests and proven to be able to guide the robot with an accuracy of +/-2 cm. It has been shown that color vision is feasible for single plant identification, i.e., discriminating between crops and weeds.

abstract = {Electronics, software and sensor systems have become key technologies in agriculture. Future development steps are autonomous field robots with high technological challenges and options for economical and ecological benefits. The robustness of autonomous robots is considered to be of highest relevance for a step from present research activities towards prototypes. The application ‘crop scout' has been identified as a promising option to realise such a robot, called BoniRob, in an interdisciplinary cooperation with partners from electronic and agricultural industry as well as research institutions from engineering and agriculture. The vehicle is based on four wheel hub motors and hydraulic components, thereby offering a high flexibility with respect to navigation and changing height positions. Multi-sensor fusion - including complex sensor systems like spectral imaging and 3D time-of-flight cameras – and a RTK-DGPS system are applied for an individual plant phenotyping. The navigation concept of BoniRob is based on probabilistic robotics. A Gazebo-based 3D simulation environment for BoniRob is developed, including options for data and software exchange between the simulator and the real robot. In the first stage maize and wheat are considered for phenotyping, sensor and plant parameters have been defined according to the extended BBCH scale. As an additional option mapping of plant diseases based on spectral imaging information will be evaluated. The automatic phenotyping and mapping of all plants in a field will be a revolutionary change in the methods of field trials. Moreover, the availability of a robust crops scout platform will offer options for other field applications.},

abstract = {Accurate crop-load estimation is important for efficient management of pre- and post-harvest operations. This information is crucial for the planning of labor and equipment requirement for harvesting and transporting fruit from the orchard to packing house. Current machine vision-based techniques for crop-load estimation have achieved only limited success mostly due to: (i) occlusion of apples by branches, leaves and/or other apples, and (ii) variable outdoor lighting conditions. In order to minimize the effect of these factors, a new sensor system was developed with an over-the-row platform integrated with a tunnel structure which acquired images from opposite sides of apple trees. The tunnel structure minimized illumination of apples with direct sunlight and reduced the variability in lighting condition. Images captured in a tall spindle orchard were processed for identifying apples, which achieved an identification accuracy of 79.8{\%}. The location of apples in three-dimensional (3D) space was used to eliminate duplicate counting of apples that were visible to cameras from both sides of the tree canopy. The error on identifying duplicate apples was found to be 21.1{\%}. Overall, the method achieved an accuracy of 82{\%} on estimating crop-load on trees with dual side imaging compared to 58{\%} with single side imaging. Over-the-row machine vision system showed promise for accurate and reliable apple crop-load estimation in the apple orchards.},

abstract = {Through automated agricultural inspection, farmers can potentially achieve better productivity and accurately predict yields and crop quality. A variety of sensors can be used for agricultural inspection, but the cheapest and most information-rich is the video camera. We collect data in the field from a monocular camera fixed to a mobile inspection platform. For purposes of pineapple crop mapping and yield prediction, we propose an image processing framework for in-field fruit detection, tracking, and 3D reconstruction. We perform a series of experiments on feature point extraction using Harris, SIFT, and SURF features, feature point description using SIFT and SURF descriptors, feature point classification using SVMs, fruit region tracking using blob tracking, and 3D reconstruction using structure from motion and robust ellipsoid estimation techniques. We find that SURF feature points and descriptors provide the best tradeoff between processing time and classification accuracy and that the method is sufficiently accurate for fruit region detection. Our preliminary results for fruit region tracking and 3D fruit reconstruction are promising. We plan further work towards development of a useful aid to help farmers manage their farms.},

abstract = {Forecasting the grape yield of vineyards is of critical importance in the wine industry, as it allows grape growers to more accurately and con dently invests in capital equipment, negotiate pricing, schedule labour and develop marketing strategies. Currently, industry standard forecasts are generated by manual sampling of bunch weights, grape size, grape numbers and seasonal predictions which takes signi cant time and e ort and thus can sample a very small proportion of the vines. The rst step in automating this procedure is to accurately estimate the weight of fruit on the vine and thus this paper presents a survey of the automated image processing methods which have been applied to this problem. Using manually harvested bunches photographed in a laboratory environment, the contribution of various bunch parameters to the weight of a bunch was examined to provide a baseline for the accuracy of weight calculation methods. Then, several recent colour classi cation methods were compared using images of grapes in vivo. The results showed that a linear regression approach to bunch weight estimation using berry number, bunch perimeter, bunch area and estimated bunch volume was accurate to within 5.3{\%}. Results from in vivo colour classi cation showed a weight prediction accuracy of 4.5{\%} on a much smaller dataset, demonstrating the promise of this approach in achieving grape grower yield estimation targets.},

The operation of the FLC was graphically simulated under the real condition of the orchard. Machine vision was used to determine vehicle heading and four ultrasonic sensors were used to detect obstacles during the operation. Operation time duration of the hydraulic cylinders was inferred as output of the FLC. The results of simulation showed that the speed sprayer could be operated autonomously by the FLC that used sensor inputs from machine vision and ultrasonic sensors. After the graphic simulation, autonomous speed sprayer operation in a real orchard was conducted using the developed FLC. Orchard image analysis and signals of ultrasonic sensors were processed in real time. The speed sprayer was modified to be steered by two hydraulic cylinders. The results of field test showed that the speed sprayer could be operated by the FLC. The ultrasonic sensors didn't contribute to the improvement of guidance performance; however, they assisted the speed sprayer to avoid trees or obstacles in emergent situations.},

The fruit shape features were extracted from contour images based on random ring method (RRM). A matching algorithm based on area and epipolar geometry was discussed to locate the apples. The apples with similar areas were matched according to the principle of ordering constraint by calculating the maximum value of cross-correlation function of vertical projections. The experiment results showed that the proposed recognition method could eliminate the influences of shade and soil. Over 89.5{\%} of fruits were successfully recognized from 160 tested images. The circle centers and radii were extracted precisely based on the random ring method. The errors were less than 20. mm when the measuring distance was between 400. mm and 1500. mm.},

The vehicle presented here is adapted to operate in 0.25 and 0.5 m row crops and equipped with cameras for row guidance and weed detection. A modular approach is taken with four identical wheel modules, allowing four wheel steering and propulsion of the platform. The result is improved mobility which allows parallel displacement of the vehicle during turns by decoupling adjustments in position from adjustments in orientation. Control of the platform is provided through a vehicle electronics and control system based on embedded controllers and standard communication protocols. The software implements a hybrid deliberate software architecture that allows a hierarchical decomposition of the operation. The lowest level implements a reactive feedback control mechanism based on an extension of simple control for car-like vehicles to the four wheel case. The controller design forces the front and rear of the vehicle to follow a pre-determined path and allows the vehicle to maintain a fixed orientation relative to the path. The controller rationale is outlined and results from experiments in the field are presented. ?? 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Machine vision technologies hold the promise of enabling rapid and accurate fruit crop yield predictions in the field. The key to fulfilling this promise is accurate segmentation and detection of fruit in images of tree canopies. This paper proposes two new methods for automated counting of fruit in images of mango tree canopies, one using texture-based dense segmentation and one using shape-based fruit detection, and compares the use of these methods relative to existing techniques:—(i) a method based on K-nearest neighbour pixel classification and contour segmentation, and (ii) a method based on super-pixel over-segmentation and classification using support vector machines. The robustness of each algorithm was tested on multiple sets of images of mango trees acquired over a period of 3 years. These image sets were acquired under varying conditions (light and exposure), distance to the tree, average number of fruit on the tree, orchard and season. For images collected under the same conditions as the calibration images, estimated fruit numbers were within 16 {\%} of actual fruit numbers, and the F1 measure of detection performance was above 0.68 for these methods. Results were poorer when models were used for estimating fruit numbers in trees of different canopy shape and when different imaging conditions were used. For fruit-background segmentation, K-nearest neighbour pixel classification based on colour and smoothness or pixel classification based on super-pixel over-segmentation, clustering of dense scale invariant feature transform features into visual words and bag-of-visual-word super-pixel classification using support vector machines was more effective than simple contrast and colour based segmentation. Pixel classification was best followed by fruit detection using an elliptical shape model or blob detection using colour filtering and morphological image processing techniques. Method results were also compared using precision–recall plots. Imaging at night under artificial illumination with careful attention to maintaining constant illumination conditions is highly recommended.},

abstract = {A machine vision system utilizing color vision was investigated as a means to identify citrus fruits and to estimate yield information of the citrus grove in real-time. Images were acquired for 98 citrus trees in a commercial grove located near Orlando, Florida. The trees were distributed over 48 plots evenly. Images were taken in stationary mode using a machine vision system consisting of a color analog camera, a DGPS receiver, and an encoder. Non-overlapping images of the citrus trees were taken by determining the field of view of the camera and using an encoder to measure the traveled distance to locate the next position for acquiring an image. The threshold of segmentation of the images to recognize citrus fruits was estimated from the pixel distribution in the HSI color plane. A computer vision algorithm to enhance and extract information from the images was developed. The total time for processing an image was 119.5 ms, excluding image acquisition time. The image processing algorithm was tested on 329 validation images and the R 2 value between the number of fruits counted by the fruit counting algorithm and the average number of fruits counted manually was 0.79. Images belonging to a same plot were grouped together and the number of fruits estimated by the fruit counting algorithm was summed up to give the number of fruits/plot estimates. Leaving out outliers and incomplete data, the remaining 44 plots were divided into calibration and validation data sets and a model was developed for citrus yield using the calibration data set. The R 2 value between the number of fruits/plot counted by the yield prediction model and the number of fruits/plot counted by hand harvesting for the validation data set was 0.53.},

Images were acquired at night, using artificial lighting of fruit at an earlier stage of maturation ('stone hardening' stage) than for the previous study. Multiple image sets were collected during the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Despite altering the settings of the filters in the algorithm presented in the previous study (based on colour segmentation using RGB and YCbCr, and texture), the less mature fruit were poorly identified, due to a lower extent of red colouration of the skin. The algorithm was altered to reduce its dependence on colour features and to increase its use of texture filtering, hessian filtering in particular, to remove leaves, trunk and stems. Results on a calibration set of images (2011) were significantly improved, with 78.3{\%} of fruit detected, an error rate of 10.6{\%} and an R2 value (machine vision to manual count) of 0.63. Further application of the approach on validation sets from 2011 and 2012 had mixed results, with issues related to variation in foliage characteristics between sets. It is proposed the detection approaches within both of these algorithms be used as a 'toolkit' for a mango detection system, within an expert system that also uses user input to improve the accuracy of the system. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Fully automated yield estimation of intact fruits prior to harvesting provides various benefits to farmers. Until now, several studies have been conducted to estimate fruit yield using image-processing technologies. However, most of these techniques require thresholds for features such as color, shape and size. In addition, their performance strongly depends on the thresholds used, although optimal thresholds tend to vary with images. Furthermore, most of these techniques have attempted to detect only mature and immature fruits, although the number of young fruits is more important for the prediction of long-term fluctuations in yield. In this study, we aimed to develop a method to accurately detect individual intact tomato fruits including mature, immature and young fruits on a plant using a conventional RGB digital camera in conjunction with machine learning approaches. The developed method did not require an adjustment of threshold values for fruit detection from each image because image segmentation was conducted based on classification models generated in accordance with the color, shape, texture and size of the images. The results of fruit detection in the test images showed that the developed method achieved a recall of 0.80, while the precision was 0.88. The recall values of mature, immature and young fruits were 1.00, 0.80 and 0.78, respectively.},

abstract = {Applying robotics in plant production requires the integration of robot capabilities, plant culture, and the work environment. Commercial plant production requires certain cultural practices to be performed on the plants under certain environmental conditions. Some of the environmental conditions are mostly natural and some are modified or controlled. In many cases, the required cultural practices dictate the layout and materials how of the production system, Both the cultural and environmental factors significantly affect when, where and how the plants are manipulated. Several cultural practices are commonly known in the plant production industry. The ones which have been the subject of robotics research include division and transfer of plant materials in micropropagation, transplanting of seedlings, sticking of cuttings, grafting, pruning, and harvesting of fruit and vegetables. The plants are expected to change their shape and size during growth and development. Robotics technology includes many sub-topics including the manipulator mechanism and its control, end-effector design, sensing techniques, mobility, and workcell development. The robots which are to be used for performing plant cultural tasks must recognize and understand the physical properties of each unique object and must be able to work under various environmental conditions in fields or controlled environments. This article will present some considerations and examples of robotics development for plant production followed by a description of the key components of plant production robots. A case study on developing a harvesting robot for an up-side-down single truss tomato production system will also be described.},

abstract = {This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks and operations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widely demonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructured environments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, developments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, structures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performance measures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital for comparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisation and assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and to each task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic environments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low action success rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated into multi-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rate increased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems will enable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on each of these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Research needs to focus on the field use of autonomous or human–robot systems, the latter being a reasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should be suited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.},

To deal with this challenge, we develop and deploy a computer vision system for automated, rapid and accurate yield estimation. The system uses a two-camera stereo rig for image acquisition. It works at nighttime with controlled artificial lighting to reduce the variance of natural illumination. An autonomous orchard vehicle is used as the support platform for automated data collection. The system scans the both sides of each tree row in orchards. A computer vision algorithm is developed to detect and register apples from acquired sequential images, and then generate apple counts as crop yield estimation. We de- ployed the yield estimation system in Washington state in September, 2011. The results show that the developed system works well with both red and green apples in the tall-spindle planting system. The errors of crop yield estimation are -3.2$\backslash${\%} for a red apple block with about 480 trees, and 1.2$\backslash${\%} for a green apple block with about 670 trees.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to fruit detection using deep convolutional neural networks. The aim is to build an accurate, fast and reliable fruit detection system, which is a vital element of an autonomous agricultural robotic platform; it is a key element for fruit yield estimation and automated harvesting. Recent work in deep neural networks has led to the development of a state-of-the-art object detector termed Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN). We adapt this model, through transfer learning, for the task of fruit detection using imagery obtained from two modalities: colour (RGB) and Near-Infrared (NIR). Early and late fusion methods are explored for combining the multi-modal (RGB and NIR) information. This leads to a novel multi-modal Faster R-CNN model, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work with the F1 score, which takes into account both precision and recall performances improving from     0 . 807     to     0 . 838     for the detection of sweet pepper. In addition to improved accuracy, this approach is also much quicker to deploy for new fruits, as it requires bounding box annotation rather than pixel-level annotation (annotating bounding boxes is approximately an order of magnitude quicker to perform). The model is retrained to perform the detection of seven fruits, with the entire process taking four hours to annotate and train the new model per fruit.},

abstract = {The off-road machine industry is transitioning from electric- and hydraulic-assisted technologies to computer-assisted technologies. The main enabler for this transition is the use of a communication network embedded on the machine. This often doubles the electrical complexity and cost of the on-board electronics for the machine. However, the value of built-in diagnostics and monitoring of important machine features offsets the added cost and complexity of the electronics. Once this network and architecture is in place, there is opportunity for adding control features, enhanced diagnostics, and specialty sensors that can create significant value to the machine with a minimum of added cost. This paper will describe the types of sensors used for four principle roles on a machine. The sensors' specific requirements will be compared by use. Often the accuracy requirements for a sensor increase by nearly an order of magnitude between monitoring functions and control and diagnostics functions. This paper discusses the state of the art for the use of sensors in off-road machines from a life-cycle perspective ranging from emerging to mature usage needs.},

abstract = {Corn (Zeamays L.) grown under aMediterranean semiarid climate requires supplemental irrigation to maximize the grain yield. Since the cost of irrigation application has been increasing, elimination of unnecessary irrigation applications would improve economics of corn production. There has been much interest in the crop water stress index (CWSI) as a potential tool for irrigation scheduling and yield estimation. An experiment was conducted to monitor and quantify water stress, and to develop parameters for irrigation scheduling and grain yield of summer-grown corn as a function of CWSI under Medi- terranean semiarid cropping conditions. Three irrigation treatments were based on replenishing the 0.9-m deep root zone to field capacity when the soil water level dropped to 25, 50, and 75{\%} of available water holding capacity (AWHC). A dryland treatment was also in- cluded. The lower (nonstressed) and upper (stressed) baselines were measured to calculateCWSI.Anequation that can be used to calculate the yield potential of summer-grown corn under a Mediterranean climate was developed using the relationship between the corn grain yield and the seasonal mean CWSI. Permitting the seasonal average CWSI value to exceed more than 0.22 resulted in decreased corn grain yield. The CWSI behaved as expected, dropping to near zero following an irrigation and increasing gradually as corn plants depleted soil water reserves.Weconcluded thatCWSIis a useful tool to monitor and quantify the water stress of corn under aMediterranean climate},

abstract = {The wild blueberry industry of North America may benefit significantly from precision agriculture technology. Currently, crop management practices are implemented on an average basis without considering the substantial variation in soil properties, bare spots, topographic features, and yield in blueberry fields. Yield maps along with fertility, weed, and topographic maps can be used to generate prescription maps for site-specific application of agrochemicals. Two wild blueberry fields were selected in central Nova Scotia to evaluate a photographic method for fruit yield estimation. A 10-megapixel 24-bit digital color camera was mounted on a tripod and pointed downwards to take photographs of the blueberry crop from a height of approximately 1 m. At harvest time, blueberry crop images were collected in each field at 30 different sample locations displaying a range in yield. Actual fruit yield was sampled from the same locations by hand-harvesting a 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrat, using a commercial blueberry rake. Custom image processing software was developed to count the blue pixels of ripe fruit in the quadrat region of each image and express it as a percentage of total quadrat pixels. Linear regression was used to calibrate the fruit yield with percentage blue pixels separately in each field and then the calibration equation of field 1 was used to predict fruit yield in field 2 for validation of the method. Percentage blue pi2xels correlated highly significantly with manually harvested fruit yield in field 1 (R2 = 0.98, n = 30) and field 2 (R2 = 0.99, n = 30). The correlation between actual and predicted fruit yield in the second field (validation) was also highly significant (R2 = 0.99, n = 30, RMSE = 277 kg/ha). Non-significance of the t-test for actual versus predicted yield indicated that there was no bias in the yield estimation and that the predicted yield was accurate. Based on these results, an automated yield monitoring system consisting of a digital camera, computer, and DGPS will be developed and incorporated into a harvester to monitor and map blueberry fruit yield in real time.},

abstract = {This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks and operations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widely demonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructured environments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, developments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, structures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performance measures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital for comparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisation and assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and to each task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic environments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low action success rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated into multi-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rate increased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems will enable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on each of these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Research needs to focus on the field use of autonomous or human–robot systems, the latter being a reasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should be suited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.},

abstract = {We present a vision system that automatically predicts yield in vineyards accurately and with high resolution. Yield estimation traditionally requires tedious hand measurement, which is destructive, sparse in sampling, and inaccurate. Our method is efficient, high-resolution, and it is the first such system evaluated in realistic experimentation over several years and hundreds of vines spread over several acres of different vineyards. Other existing research is limited to small test sets of 10 vines or less, or just isolated grape clusters, with tightly controlled image acquisition and with artificially induced yield distributions. The system incorporates cameras and illumination mounted on a vehicle driving through the vineyard. We process images by exploiting the three prominent visual cues of texture, color, and shape into a strong classifier that detects berries even when they are of similar color to the vine leaves. We introduce methods to maximize the spatial and the overall accuracy of the yield estimates by optimizing the relationship between image measurements and yield. Our experimentation is conducted over four growing seasons in several wine and table-grape vineyards. These are the first such results from experimentation that is sufficiently sized for fair evaluation against true yield variation and real-world imaging conditions from a moving vehicle. Analysis of the results demonstrates yield estimates that capture up to 75{\%} of spatial yield variance and with an average error between 3{\%} and 11{\%} of total yield.},

abstract = {Early forecasting of fruit orchard yield is important for market planning and for growers and exporters to plan labour, bins, storage and purchase of packing materials. Large variations in tree yield pose a challenge for accurate yield estimation. We evaluated a three-level systematic sampling procedure for unbiased estimation of fruit number for yield forecasts. In the Spring of 2009 we estimated the total number of fruit in several rows of each of 14 commercial fruit orchards growing apple (11 groves), kiwifruit (two groves), and table grapes (one grove) in central Chile. Survey times were 10–100 min for apples (depending on vigour), 85 min for the table grapes, and 85 and 150 min for the kiwifruit. During harvest in the Fall, the fruit were counted to obtain the true number. Yields ranged from lows of several thousand (grape bunches), to highs of more than 40 000 fruit (apples, kiwifruit). Absolute true errors (defined as the absolute difference between the estimate and the true value, divided by the true value) were less than 5{\%} in six orchards, between 5 and 10{\%} in a further five orchards and 13{\%} in one orchard. In two apple orchards we obtained absolute true errors of about 20{\%}. Error analysis based on systematic sub-sampling across each sampling stage was used to determine how to distribute sampling effort to achieve a total coefficient of error of 10{\%}. We discuss the extension of the procedure for yield estimation at the full orchard scale for any target precision.},

abstract = {Mechanization of the harvesting of fruits, and primarily of those that are destined for the fresh market, is highly desirable in many countries due to the decrease in seasonal labour availability. Some of the technology exists for harvesting fruit intended for processing, but its utilization for soft, fresh fruit is limited, because of the excessive mechanical damage to the fruit during mechanical harvesting. An alternative to the current mechanical harvesting systems, superior from the point of view of fruit quality, but far more ambitious, is automated fruit picking with a robotic system which emulates the human picker. The challenge of developing a cost-effective robotic system for fruit picking has been taken up by researchers at several places in the world. The major problems that have to be solved with a robotic picking system are recognizing and locating the fruit and detaching it according to prescribed criteria, without damaging either the fruit or the tree. In addition, the robotic system needs to be economically sound to warrant its use as an alternative method to hand picking. This paper reviews the work carried out during the past 10 years in several countries, in developing a robot for picking fruit. Its major objective is to focus on the technological progress made so far, point out the problems still to be solved, and outline the conditions, technological and socio-economic, under which the robotic method will be accepted.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-class image segmentation approach to automate fruit segmentation. A feature learning algorithm combined with a conditional random field is applied to multi-spectral image data. Current classification methods used in agriculture scenarios tend to use hand crafted application-based features. In contrast, our approach uses unsupervised feature learning to automatically capture most relevant features from the data. This property makes our approach robust against variance in canopy trees and therefore has the potential to be applied to different domains. The proposed algorithm is applied to a fruit segmentation problem for a robotic agricultural surveillance mission, aiming to provide yield estimation with high accuracy and robustness against fruit variance. Experimental results with data collected in an almond farm are shown. The segmentation is performed with features extracted from multi-spectral (colour and infrared) data. We achieve a global classification accuracy of 88{\%}.},

abstract = {Electronics, software and sensor systems have become key technologies in agriculture. Future development steps are autonomous field robots with high technological challenges and options for economical and ecological benefits. The robustness of autonomous robots is considered to be of highest relevance for a step from present research activities towards prototypes. The application ‘crop scout' has been identified as a promising option to realise such a robot, called BoniRob, in an interdisciplinary cooperation with partners from electronic and agricultural industry as well as research institutions from engineering and agriculture. The vehicle is based on four wheel hub motors and hydraulic components, thereby offering a high flexibility with respect to navigation and changing height positions. Multi-sensor fusion - including complex sensor systems like spectral imaging and 3D time-of-flight cameras – and a RTK-DGPS system are applied for an individual plant phenotyping. The navigation concept of BoniRob is based on probabilistic robotics. A Gazebo-based 3D simulation environment for BoniRob is developed, including options for data and software exchange between the simulator and the real robot. In the first stage maize and wheat are considered for phenotyping, sensor and plant parameters have been defined according to the extended BBCH scale. As an additional option mapping of plant diseases based on spectral imaging information will be evaluated. The automatic phenotyping and mapping of all plants in a field will be a revolutionary change in the methods of field trials. Moreover, the availability of a robust crops scout platform will offer options for other field applications.},

abstract = {A robotic platform for mapping of weed populations in fields was used to demonstrate intelligent concepts for autonomous vehicles in agriculture which may eventually result in a new sustainable model for developed agriculture. The vehicle presented here is adapted to operate in 0.25 and 0.5 m row crops and equipped with cameras for row guidance and weed detection. A modular approach is taken with four identical wheel modules, allowing four wheel steering and propulsion of the platform. The result is improved mobility which allows parallel displacement of the vehicle during turns by decoupling adjustments in position from adjustments in orientation. Control of the platform is provided through a vehicle electronics and control system based on embedded controllers and standard communication protocols. The software implements a hybrid deliberate software architecture that allows a hierarchical decomposition of the operation. The lowest level implements a reactive feedback control mechanism based on an extension of simple control for car-like vehicles to the four wheel case. The controller design forces the front and rear of the vehicle to follow a pre-determined path and allows the vehicle to maintain a fixed orientation relative to the path. The controller rationale is outlined and results from experiments in the field are presented. ?? 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Monitoring crop condition and production estimates at the state and county level is of great interest to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture conducts field interviews with sampled farm operators and obtains crop cuttings to make crop yield estimates at regional and state levels. NASS needs supplemental spatial data that provides timely information on crop condition and potential yields. In this research, the crop model EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) was adapted for simulations at regional scales. Satellite remotely sensed data provide a real-time assessment of the magnitude and variation of crop condition parameters, and this study investigates the use of these parameters as an input to a crop growth model. This investigation was conducted in the semi-arid region of North Dakota in the southeastern part of the state. The primary objective was to evaluate a method of integrating parameters. retrieved from satellite imagery in a crop growth model to simulate spring wheat yields at the sub-county and county levels. The input parameters derived from remotely sensed data provided spatial integrity, as well as a real-time calibration of model simulated parameters during the season, to ensure that the modeled and observed conditions agree. A radiative transfer model, SAIL (Scattered by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves), provided the link between the satellite data and crop model. The model parameters were simulated in a geographic information system grid, which was the platform for aggregating yields at local and regional scales. A model calibration was performed to initialize the model parameters. This calibration was performed using Landsat data over three southeast counties in North Dakota. The model was then used to simulate crop yields for the state of North Dakota with inputs derived from NOAA AVHRR data. The calibration and the state level simulations are compared with spring wheat yields reported by NASS objective yield surveys.},

abstract = {Andalusia (southern Spain) is the largest olive (Olea europaea L.) oil producing region in the world. This study sought to identify the main factors influencing olive fruit production in this region, by modeling pollen release as an index of flowering intensity, field floral phenology data, and meteorological data over the fruiting season in three main olive-producing provinces,of Andalusia: Jaen, Cordoba, and Granada. Field floral phenological data were used to determine the anthesis phase, to ascertain which period of the pollination records should be included in the models. Forecast models indicated that annual prepeak pollen index (pI) was the variable most influencing the final olive crop. Spring and summer rainfall and both maximum and minimum temperatures in summer and autumn were the major weather-related parameters affecting final fruit production, although statistical analysis revealed differences between sites with regard to the timing and the degree of their influence. Validation results confirmed the validity and accuracy of the widely-used Hirst volumetric trap as a tool for olive crop yield forecasting in high-density olive-growing areas. The models used here provided earlier and more accurate crop estimates than those traditionally used by the Andalusian regional government, and may thus enable farmers, as well as government departments, to improve both crop yield management and olive oil marketing strategies and policies.},

abstract = {Reliable crop volume estimations are an increasing necessity to allow optimised and effective agronomic management. In this paper, a methodology to evaluate future olive crop yield several months in advance is presented. Olive tree phenology, airborne pollen concentrations, meteorological data and fruit production data were analysed in the province of C??rdoba (Andalusia, Spain) over a period of 20 years (1982-2002). Data were integrated to obtain models for predicting fruit production. In this study, annual Olea pollen emission is shown to be a reliable bio-indicator to forecast olive fruit production up to 8 months in advance. Hirst volumetric pollen traps were found to be an accurate tool in olive crop yield forecasting. May rainfall was the most important meteorological parameter affecting final fruit production. Three statistical models, with different elapsed time between crop estimation and harvest, were developed: 8, 4 and 2 months. All showed high determination coefficients (73-98{\%}) with a significance of 99{\%}. The models revealed no significant differences between expected and actual data in the 2001/2002 olive harvest (not included in the model). Comparisons with other estimations from the regional government indicated that the meteo-aerobiological methodology showed higher anticipation and also a higher level of coincidence between expected and actual data. In addition to the positive results from this study, the scientific basis of the statistical performance provides accuracy and objectivity to this forecasting methodology. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Applying robotics in plant production requires the integration of robot capabilities, plant culture, and the work environment. Commercial plant production requires certain cultural practices to be performed on the plants under certain environmental conditions. Some of the environmental conditions are mostly natural and some are modified or controlled. In many cases, the required cultural practices dictate the layout and materials how of the production system, Both the cultural and environmental factors significantly affect when, where and how the plants are manipulated. Several cultural practices are commonly known in the plant production industry. The ones which have been the subject of robotics research include division and transfer of plant materials in micropropagation, transplanting of seedlings, sticking of cuttings, grafting, pruning, and harvesting of fruit and vegetables. The plants are expected to change their shape and size during growth and development. Robotics technology includes many sub-topics including the manipulator mechanism and its control, end-effector design, sensing techniques, mobility, and workcell development. The robots which are to be used for performing plant cultural tasks must recognize and understand the physical properties of each unique object and must be able to work under various environmental conditions in fields or controlled environments. This article will present some considerations and examples of robotics development for plant production followed by a description of the key components of plant production robots. A case study on developing a harvesting robot for an up-side-down single truss tomato production system will also be described.},

abstract = {The no-slip boundary condition for liquid flows in microchannel has been applied successfully although it has no theoretical foundation. Liquid molecules, however, can slip at the liquid-solid interfaces if the liquid has a lower wettability. The velocity slip at the solid wall, called the Navier slip, is proportional to the velocity gradient at the wall for given wall physicochemical properties. Since the electroosmotic flow has a sharp velocity variation at the wall, the Navier slip of electroosmotic flow can be appreciable in a microchannel where there may be negligible Navier slip for a purely pressure-driven flow which has a smoother velocity variation at the wall. The Navier slip affects the volumetric flow rate and streaming potential significantly in electrokinetic flows and, therefore, one must be cautious about the possible occurrence of Navier slip in the design and operation of various microfluidic devices. In the present work, we have devised a simple method of estimating both Navier slip coefficient and zeta potential by measuring both the volumetric flow rate under a given pressure gradient after eliminating streaming potential and streaming potential under a given pressure gradient. Instead of streaming potential, one may adopt volumetric flow rate under a given external electric field. The method relies on a semi-analytic formula derived in the present work, which allows evaluation of streaming potential and volumetric flow rate without the necessity of numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. The present method is found to estimate both slip coefficient and zeta potential reasonably accurately even using contaminated experimental data.},

abstract = {In the present work we explore some aspects of energy harvesting from unsteady, turbulent fluid flow using piezoelectric generators. Turbulent flows exhibit a large degree of coherence in their spatial and temporal scales, which provides a unique opportunity for energy harvesting. The voltage generated by short, flexible piezoelectric cantilever beams placed inside turbulent boundary layers and wakes of circular cylinders at high Reynolds numbers is inves- tigated. Matching the fluid flow's predominant frequency with the natural frequency of the piezoelectric generator appears to maximize the piezoelectric output voltage. This voltage is also dependent on the generator's location inside the flow field. A three-way coupled interaction simulation that takes into account the aerodynamics, structural vibration, and electrical response of the piezoelectric generator has been developed. The simulation results agree rea- sonably well with the experimental data paving the way of using such a tool to estimate the performance of different energy harvesting devices within unsteady flow fields.},

abstract = {Pressure-driven flow of an electrolyte solution in a microchannel with charged solid surfaces induces a streaming potential across the microchannel. Such a flow also causes rejection of ions by the microchannel, leading to different concentrations in the feed and permeate reservoirs connecting the capillary, which forms the basis of membrane based separation of electrolytes. Modeling approaches traditionally employed to assess the streaming potential development and ion rejection by capillaries often present a confusing picture of the governing electrochemical transport processes. In this paper, a transient numerical simulation of electrochemical transport process leading to the development of a streaming potential across a finite length circular cylindrical microchannel connecting two infinite reservoirs is presented. The solution based on finite element analysis shows the transient development of ionic concentrations, electric fields, and the streaming potential over the length of the microchannel. The transient analysis presented here resolves several contradictions between the two types of modeling approaches employed in assessing streaming potential development and ion rejection. The simulation results show that the streaming potential across the channel is predominantly set up at the timescale of the developing convective transport, while the equilibrium ion concentrations are developed over a considerably longer duration.},

@article{Kane2013,
abstract = {Penetrating microelectrode arrays with 2000 $\mu$m (2) sputtered iridium oxide (SIROF) electrode sites were implanted in cat cerebral cortex, and their long-term electrochemical performance evaluated in vivo by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and current pulsing. Measurements were made from days 33 to 328 postimplantation. The CV-defined charge storage capacity, measured at 50 mV/s, increased linearly with time over the course of implantation for two arrays and was unchanged for one array. A modest decrease in 1 kHz impedance was also observed. These results suggest an ongoing increase in the apparent electrochemical surface area of the electrodes, which is attributed to electrical leakage pathways arising from cracking of Parylene insulation observed by SEM of explanted arrays. During current pulsing with a 0.0 V interpulse bias, the electrodes readily delivered 8 nC/phase in vitro, but some channels approached or exceeded the water reduction potential during in vivo pulsing. The charge injection capacity in vivo increased linearly with the interpulse bias (0-0.6 V Ag$\backslash$vert AgCl) from 11.5 to 21.8 nC/ph and with pulse width (150-500 $\mu$s) from 8.8 to 14 nC/ph (at 0.0 V bias). These values are lower than those determined from measurements in buffered physiological saline, emphasizing the importance of in vivo measurements in assessing chronic electrode performance. The consequence of current leakage pathways on the charge-injection measurements is also discussed.},

abstract = {We theoretically evaluate the prospect of using electrokinetic phenomena to convert hydrostatic energy to electrical power. An expression is derived for the energy conversion efficiency of a two-terminal fluidic device in terms of its linear electrokinetic response properties. For a slitlike nanochannel of constant surface charge density, we predict that the maximum energy conversion efficiency occurs at low salt concentrations. An analytic expression for the regime of strong double-layer overlap reveals that the efficiency depends only on the ratio of the channel height to the Gouy-Chapman length, and the product of the viscosity and the counterion mobility. We estimate that an electrokinetic energy conversion device could achieve a maximum efficiency of 12{\%} for simple monovalent ions in aqueous solution.},

abstract = {Pressure-driven flow in a microchannel induces a streaming current due to the presence of an electrical double layer in the interface between the electrolyte solution and channel wall. As the streaming current is of the order of a nano-amphere and is additive, we propose here a method to develop an electrokinetic battery consisting of an array of microchannels that converts the hydrostatic pressure of a liquid into electrical work. We have given oscillating analytical solutions by means of an electrical circuit analysis to model the multi-microchannel battery. Using superposition of the appropriate Fourier series, the derived analytical solutions are useful to predict the current when there is more general time-dependent flow through a microchannel array. To illustrate the idea, we have studied steady-state pressure-driven flow in micropore porous glass filter and compared the results with those predicted from our model. From a 30 cm hydrostatic pressure drop, an external current of 1–2 µA was obtained by means of water passing through the micropore porous glass filter. A larger current can be obtained by simply using a solution with higher salt concentration. This results in a new and potentially useful method of energy conversion by means of an array of microchannels.},

abstract = {This paper covers the use of jointed manipulators in handling biological materials within the horticultural industry. Potential applications are reviewed by looking at previous research work and the scope for future development based on economic as well as technical considerations. It is concluded that applications with long seasons are the most viable, with flexibility of use between tasks an important consideration for applications with short seasons. A general specification highlighting the differences between horticultural and manufacturing industry requirements has been derived and some engineering proposals put forward to meet it. The use of computer vision is thought to be the best choice of primary sensor system. A geometrical layout which allows the manipulator to approach the target along a "line of sight" is favoured, as it simplifies collision avoidance in an unstructured environment and might allow recalibration of manipulator position during extension. Pneumatic actuators are thought to offer many advantages over electric or hydraulic drives provided that adequate dynamic control can be achieved. It is concluded that the generic differences in specification between industrial and horticultural manipulators provide an opportunity to take a new approach in manipulator design. In order to provide the analytical tools necessary for this new approach further research is needed in the interrelated areas of actuator choice, geometrical configuration and control strategy.},

This research has been performed in universities and government institutes, and by agricultural machinery manufacturers. Because of funding limitations, research in universities has concentrated on methodologies, such as navigation, sensing, and application of control theory. Development of a one dimensional image sensor, and application of neural networks and genetic algorithms, has taken place at Hokkaido University; vision guidance and fuzzy logic application at the University of Tokyo; an automatic follow-up vehicle has been developed at Kyoto University; and an automatic transport vehicle at Ehime University. At research institutes and manufacturers, with their greater financial freedom, more practical systems have been developed. A tilling robot and a driver-less air blast sprayer is being developed in the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institute (BRAIN); and an autonomous rice planter, a tillage robot and autonomous forage tractor in the research institute of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery (MAFF). Kubota Co. Ltd has developed autonomous rice planting and husbandry vehicles. In Asian countries an autonomous speed sprayer is under study in Korea and an autonomous power sprayer in Taiwan, but little research is performed elsewhere in Asia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Mechanization of the harvesting of fruits, and primarily of those that are destined for the fresh market, is highly desirable in many countries due to the decrease in seasonal labour availability. Some of the technology exists for harvesting fruit intended for processing, but its utilization for soft, fresh fruit is limited, because of the excessive mechanical damage to the fruit during mechanical harvesting. An alternative to the current mechanical harvesting systems, superior from the point of view of fruit quality, but far more ambitious, is automated fruit picking with a robotic system which emulates the human picker. The challenge of developing a cost-effective robotic system for fruit picking has been taken up by researchers at several places in the world. The major problems that have to be solved with a robotic picking system are recognizing and locating the fruit and detaching it according to prescribed criteria, without damaging either the fruit or the tree. In addition, the robotic system needs to be economically sound to warrant its use as an alternative method to hand picking. This paper reviews the work carried out during the past 10 years in several countries, in developing a robot for picking fruit. Its major objective is to focus on the technological progress made so far, point out the problems still to be solved, and outline the conditions, technological and socio-economic, under which the robotic method will be accepted.},

abstract = {Electronics, software and sensor systems have become key technologies in agriculture. Future development steps are autonomous field robots with high technological challenges and options for economical and ecological benefits. The robustness of autonomous robots is considered to be of highest relevance for a step from present research activities towards prototypes. The application ‘crop scout' has been identified as a promising option to realise such a robot, called BoniRob, in an interdisciplinary cooperation with partners from electronic and agricultural industry as well as research institutions from engineering and agriculture. The vehicle is based on four wheel hub motors and hydraulic components, thereby offering a high flexibility with respect to navigation and changing height positions. Multi-sensor fusion - including complex sensor systems like spectral imaging and 3D time-of-flight cameras – and a RTK-DGPS system are applied for an individual plant phenotyping. The navigation concept of BoniRob is based on probabilistic robotics. A Gazebo-based 3D simulation environment for BoniRob is developed, including options for data and software exchange between the simulator and the real robot. In the first stage maize and wheat are considered for phenotyping, sensor and plant parameters have been defined according to the extended BBCH scale. As an additional option mapping of plant diseases based on spectral imaging information will be evaluated. The automatic phenotyping and mapping of all plants in a field will be a revolutionary change in the methods of field trials. Moreover, the availability of a robust crops scout platform will offer options for other field applications.},

abstract = {The object of the work was to demonstrate individual spot treatment with spray of transplanted cauliflower from a small vehicle that could operate autonomously within a field. The only prior information required was to be the plant spacing, an approximate row length and the number of beds. To achieve this a small horticultural toolframe tractor was fitted with navigation and computer control equipment and an experimental marking device. A charged couple device (CCD) was located centrally at the front of the vehicle looking forward and down in order to provide images of crop rows. The images were analysed to provide guidance information. Signals from vehicle motion sensors (odometry and accelerometers) and a compass were combined with the image analysis data to provide vehicle control information that was robust to natural variability. A segmentation was performed using image intensity, size and geometric information to pick out crop plants requiring treatment. This information was passed to the treatment device controller which selected from an array of 27 solenoid valves to operate appropriate spray nozzles arranged transversely across the machine. Field trials of selective spray treatment of a young transplanted crop, conducted at a vehicle speed of 0{\textperiodcentered}7 m/s, showed that all plants were treated, though coverage of each plant was not perfect. Mean measured error along the row was 1 mm and lateral error 11 mm. The standard deviation in these errors were 26 and 20 mm, respectively. Only 8{\%} of the total area of the bed was covered with spray, thus showing a potentially large saving in agro-chemicals with environmental and economic advantages. The vehicle has been operated extensively in a wide variety of crops of different sizes and ground coverage, with good reliability under favourable lighting conditions.},

abstract = {The off-road machine industry is transitioning from electric- and hydraulic-assisted technologies to computer-assisted technologies. The main enabler for this transition is the use of a communication network embedded on the machine. This often doubles the electrical complexity and cost of the on-board electronics for the machine. However, the value of built-in diagnostics and monitoring of important machine features offsets the added cost and complexity of the electronics. Once this network and architecture is in place, there is opportunity for adding control features, enhanced diagnostics, and specialty sensors that can create significant value to the machine with a minimum of added cost. This paper will describe the types of sensors used for four principle roles on a machine. The sensors' specific requirements will be compared by use. Often the accuracy requirements for a sensor increase by nearly an order of magnitude between monitoring functions and control and diagnostics functions. This paper discusses the state of the art for the use of sensors in off-road machines from a life-cycle perspective ranging from emerging to mature usage needs.},

abstract = {Embedded systems become more and more widespread, especially autonomous ones, and clearly tend to be ubiquitous. In such systems, low-power and low-energy usage get ever more crucial. Furthermore, these issues also become paramount in (massively) multi-processors systems, either in one machine or more widely in a grid. The various problems faced pertain to autonomy, power supply possibilities, thermal dissipation, or even sheer energy cost. Although it has since long been studied in harware, energy optimization is more recent in software. In this paper, we thus aim at raising awareness to low-power and low-energy issues in the language and compilation community. We thus broadly but briefly survey techniques and solutions to this energy issue, focusing on a few specific aspects in the context of compiler optimizations and memory management.},

The resistive shunt which emerges at lower frequencies was shown to be equivalent to the direct current (d.c.) impedance of the interface. A Cole-Cole (1941) type of relaxation model is proposed to describe the interface behaviour over all frequency ranges.

This paper describes the Demeter system for automated harvesting. Demeter is a computer-controlled speedrowing machine, equipped with a pair of video cameras and a global positioning sensor for navigation. Demeter is capable of planning harvesting operations for an entire field, and then executing its plan by cutting crop rows, turning to cut successive rows, repositioning itself in the field, and detecting unexpected obstacles. In August of 1997, the Demeter system autonomously harvested 40 hectares (100 acres) of crop in a continuous run (excluding stops for refueling). During 1998, the Demeter system harvested in excess of 48.5 hectares (120 acres) of crop, cutting in a variety of fields.},

@article{Cho1999,
abstract = {A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) was developed for autonomous operation of a speed sprayer in an orchard. The operation of the FLC was graphically simulated under the real condition of the orchard. Machine vision was used to determine vehicle heading and four ultrasonic sensors were used to detect obstacles during the operation. Operation time duration of the hydraulic cylinders was inferred as output of the FLC. The results of simulation showed that the speed sprayer could be operated autonomously by the FLC that used sensor inputs from machine vision and ultrasonic sensors. After the graphic simulation, autonomous speed sprayer operation in a real orchard was conducted using the developed FLC. Orchard image analysis and signals of ultrasonic sensors were processed in real time. The speed sprayer was modified to be steered by two hydraulic cylinders. The results of field test showed that the speed sprayer could be operated by the FLC. The ultrasonic sensors didn't contribute to the improvement of guidance performance; however, they assisted the speed sprayer to avoid trees or obstacles in emergent situations.},

@article{Sodano1990,
abstract = {The field of power harvesting has experienced significant growth over the past few years due to the ever increasing desire to produce portable and wireless electronics with extended lifespan. Current portable and wireless devices must be designed to include electrochemical batteries as the power source. The use of batteries can be troublesome due to their limited lifespan, thus necessitating their periodic replacement. In the case of wireless sensors that are to be placed in remote locations, the sensor must be easily accessible or of disposable nature to allow the device to function over extended periods of time. Energy scavenging devices are designed to capture the ambient energy surrounding the electronics and convert it into usable electrical energy. The concept of power harvesting works towards developing self- powered devices that do not require replaceable power supplies. A number of sources of harvestable ambient energy exist, including waste heat, vibration, electromagnetic waves, wind, flowing water, and solar energy. While each of these sources of energy can be effectively used to power remote sensors, the structural and biological communities have placed an emphasis on scavenging vibration energy with piezoelectric materials. This article will review recent literature in the field of power harvesting and present the current state of power harvesting in its drive to create completely self-powered devices.

abstract = {Signal degradation and an array size dictated by the number of available interconnects are the two main limitations inherent to standalone microelectrode arrays (MEAs). A new biochip consisting of an array of microelectrodes with fully-integrated analog and digital circuitry realized in an industrial CMOS process addresses these issues. The device is capable of on-chip signal filtering for improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), on-chip analog and digital conversion, and multiplexing, thereby facilitating simultaneous stimulation and recording of electrogenic cell activity. The designed electrode pitch of 250 microm significantly limits the space available for circuitry: a repeated unit of circuitry associated with each electrode comprises a stimulation buffer and a bandpass filter for readout. The bandpass filter has corner frequencies of 100 Hz and 50 kHz, and a gain of 1000. Stimulation voltages are generated from an 8-bit digital signal and converted to an analog signal at a frequency of 120 kHz. Functionality of the read-out circuitry is demonstrated by the measurement of cardiomyocyte activity. The microelectrode is realized in a shifted design for flexibility and biocompatibility. Several microelectrode materials (platinum, platinum black and titanium nitride) have been electrically characterized. An equivalent circuit model, where each parameter represents a macroscopic physical quantity contributing to the interface impedance, has been successfully fitted to experimental results.},

abstract = {The taming of electricity and its widespread use allows people to see in the dark, to speak to one another instantaneously across the earth, and it allows retrieval of data from instruments sent out of the solar system. It is right to expect that the uses and demand for electricity will continue to grow, and to extend the ability to generate electricity; here two new micromachined devices for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy are presented. Aided by the wealth of micromachining process technology, generators that use an oscillatory motion to modify the physical structure of a capacitor with a built-in electric field provided by a permanent electret have been designed, built, and tested. The electret creates an electric field inside the capacitor structure, which induces mirror charge at some potential. The modification of the capacitor then generates an alternating displacement current through an external circuit, which provides useful electrical power. The electret microphone is a similar well known device for converting pressure waves into electrical signals by varying the distance between two charged capacitive plates. This work explores and proves feasible the ability to use mechanical forces to change the overlapping area of a charged capacitor structure and using mechanical forces to move a liquid into the gap of a charged capacitor structure, changing its permittivity to produce electricity. This work demonstrates 2.5mW of power from a 2cm diameter rotary generator at 12kRPM and 10$\mu$w for a 0.1cm3 linear shaking generator at 60Hz.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the economic feasibility of applying autonomous robotic vehicles compared to conventional systems in three different applications: robotic weeding in high value crops (particularly sugar beet), crop scouting in cereals and grass cutting on golf courses. The comparison was based on a systems analysis and an individual economic feasibility study for each of the three applications. The results showed that in all three scenarios, the robotic applications are more economically feasible than the conventional systems. The high cost of real time kinematics Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and the small capacity of the vehicles are the main parameters that increase the cost of the robotic systems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The principle of the proposed method encompasses forward osmosis (FO) and electrokinetic phenomena. With the salinity difference between draw and feed solutions, FO allows spontaneous water flow across a semi-permeable membrane. The flow of water is then directed through a porous medium where the electric power is generated from the electrokinetic streaming potential. With a glass porous medium and a commercial flat sheet FO membrane in a batch mode configuration, our lab scale experimental system has demonstrated the produced electrokinetic voltages of about several hundreds of milli-volts.},

abstract = {This review investigates the research effort, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, and the associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps. Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and reliable???human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and highly dynamic situation.},

abstract = {The electrode-tissues interface (ETI) is one of the key issues in implantable devices such as stimulators and sensors. Once the stimulator is implanted, safety and reliability become more and more critical. In this case, modeling and monitoring of the ETI are required. We propose an empirical model for the ETI and a dedicated integrated circuit to measure its corresponding complex impedance. These measurements in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz were achieved in acute dog experiments. The model demonstrates a closer fitting with experimental measurements. In addition, a custom monitoring device based on a stimuli current generator has been completed to evaluate the phase shift and voltage across the electrodes and to transmit wirelessly the values to an external controller. This integrated circuit has been fabricated in a CMOS 0.18 microm process, which consumes 4 mW only during measurements and occupies an area of 1 mm(2).},

abstract = {The field of nonlinear “induced-charge” electrokinetics is rapidly advancing, motivated by potential applications in microfluidics as well as by the unique opportunities it provides for probing fundamental scientific issues in electrokinetics. Over the past few years, several surprising theoretical predictions have been observed in experiments: (i) induced-charge electrophoresis of half-metallic Janus particles, perpendicular to a uniform AC field; (ii) microfluidic mixing around metallic structures by induced-charge electro-osmosis, and (iii) fast, high-pressure AC electro-osmotic pumping by non-planar electrode arrays, and ICEK effects upon the collective behavior of polarizable particle suspensions has been studied theoretically and computationally. A new experimental system enables a clean and direct comparison between theoretical predictions and measured ICEK flows, providing a route to fundamental studies of particular surfaces and high-throughput searches for optimal ICEK systems. Systematic discrepancies between theory and experiment have engendered the search for mechanisms, including new theories that account for electrochemical surface reactions, surface contamination, roughness, and the crowding of ions at high voltage. Promising directions for further research, both fundamental and applied, are discussed.},

Measurements of interfacial charge are complicated by slip and interfacial water structuring phenomena (see Part 2, this issue). Despite these complexities, it is shown that (i) several hydrophobic materials, such as Teflon and Zeonor, have predictable electrokinetic properties and (ii) electrokinetic data for hydrophobic microfluidic systems is most consistent with the postulate that hydroxyl ion adsorption is the origin of charge.},

Then, we review some of the more popular models that have been used to describe the physical phenomena behind the formation of the ionic double layer. Following this we shall enumerate the common strategies used historically to correct its influence on the measured signals in DS or in IS.

abstract = {We consider the influence of an electric field applied normal to the electric double layer at a chemically reactive surface. Our goal is to elucidate how surface chemistry affects the potential for field-effect control over micro- and nanofluidic systems, which we call electrofluidic gating. The charging of a metal-oxide-electrolyte (MOE) capacitor is first modeled analytically. We apply the Poisson-Boltzmann description of the double layer and impose chemical equilibrium between the ionizable surface groups and the solution at the solid-liquid interface. The chemically reactive surface is predicted to behave as a buffer, regulating the charge in the double layer by either protonating or deprotonating in response to the applied field. We present the dependence of the charge density and the electrochemical potential of the double layer on the applied field, the density, and the dissociation constants of ionizable surface groups and the ionic strength and the pH of the electrolyte. We simulate the responses of SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3), two widely used oxide insulators with different surface chemistries. We also consider the limits to electrofluidic gating imposed by the nonlinear behavior of the double layer and the dielectric strength of oxide materials, which were measured for SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) films in MOE configurations. Our results clarify the response of chemically reactive surfaces to applied fields, which is crucial to understanding electrofluidic effects in real devices.},

abstract = {Vanilla is the second most expensive spice worldwide. The high cost of vanilla has led to the problem of dangerous adulterated substitutes. Its high cost is attributed largely to the labor intensive hand pollination required where the melipona bee is not present. This article proposes a method of segmenting vanilla images intended for robotic control of a future automated pollination system. We present the specialization of a hypercomplex numbers based segmentation technique for vanilla flower recognition. The specialization overcomes much of the difficulty of differentiating green flowers from their similarly colored surroundings. Comparison is given to previous hypercomplex numbers based segmentation without the specialization.},

abstract = {Electrodes are widely used to measure bioelectric events and to stimulate excitable tissues. In one form or another, electrodes have been around for nearly two centuries; yet our ability to predict their properties is extremely limited, despite considerable research, especially during the last century. This paper chronicles the accumulation of knowledge about the electrode-electrolyte interface as a circuit element. Our understanding of this interface starts with the Helmholtz double layer of charge and progresses through the Warburg and Fricke low-current-density models, which demonstrated that the resistive and capacitive components are polarization elements, the values of which depend on frequency. The discovery by Schwan, showing that the components of the Warburg-Fricke model are current-density dependent, is recounted, along with the discovery of the rectifying properties of the electrode-electrolyte interface and how it was put to practical use. The very high current-density operation of the interface is discussed in terms of gas evolution, arching, and shock-wave production. Finally the evolution of recording electrodes is traced. Because electrodes can be operated over a very wide range of current density, it is unlikely that a single model can be created for the electrode-electrolyte interface, although over a restricted current-density range such a model may be possible.},

Dependence on cation concentration, buffer and cation type, pH, cation valency, and temperature are discussed. The Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel limit, which is often correctly treated as a good approximation for describing the ion concentration in the double layer, can lead to serious errors if it is extended to predict the dependence of zeta potential on the counterion concentration. For indifferent univalent electrolytes (e.g., sodium and potassium), two simple scalings for the dependence of zeta potential on counterion concentration can be derived in high- and low-zeta limits of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzman equation solution in the double layer. It is shown that for most situations relevant to microchip separations, the high-zeta limit is most applicable, leading to the conclusion that the zeta potential on silica substrates is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the molar counterion concentration. The zeta vs. pH dependence measurements from several experiments are compared by normalizing the zeta based on concentration.},

@article{McCarty2008,
abstract = {This Review discusses ionic electrets: their preparation, their mechanisms of formation, tools for their characterization, and their applications. An electret is a material that has a permanent, macroscopic electric field at its surface; this field can arise from a net orientation of polar groups in the material, or from a net, macroscopic electrostatic charge on the material. An ionic electret is a material that has a net electrostatic charge due to a difference in the number of cationic and anionic charges in the material. Any material that has ions at its surface, or accessible in its interior, has the potential to become an ionic electret. When such a material is brought into contact with some other material, ions can transfer between them. If the anions and cations have different propensities to transfer, the unequal transfer of these ions can result in a net transfer of charge between the two materials. This Review focuses on the experimental evidence and theoretical models for the formation of ionic electrets through this ion-transfer mechanism, and proposes--as a still-unproved hypothesis--that this ion-transfer mechanism may also explain the ubiquitous contact electrification ("static electricity") of materials, such as organic polymers, that do not explicitly have ions at their surface.},

Of the four, detection and identification of weeds under the wide range of conditions common to agricultural fields remains the greatest challenge.

Experiments to establish accuracy are described. These were carried out on four plots of cauliflowers with varying degrees of disruption to the visual scene. The RMS error of vehicle lateral position control was 2- mm, while the RMS error of estimated vehicle position was about 10 mm. Little effect of the disruption on position control was observed. It is concluded that these accuracies would be sufficient to control a vehicle and an associated crop treatment device but that improvements to the vehicle controller would make the control of the treatment device easier.},

Silicon, micromachined probes with multiple iridium oxide stimulating electrodes (400-1600 micron 2) were implanted in guinea pig cortex. A 10-17 day post-operative recovery period was followed by five days of monopolar stimulation, two hours/electrode each day using biphasic, constant current stimulation (5-100 microA, 100 microseconds/phase). EIS and CV data were taken before and after stimulation. The post-stimulation impedance [at mid-range frequencies (100 Hz-100 kHz)] consistently and significantly decreased relative to prestimulation levels. Impedance magnitude increased permanently at low frequencies ({\textless} 100 Hz), correlating to a change in the charge storage capacity (the area under a cyclic voltammagram). Impedance magnitude significantly increased during the recovery period, though this increase could be mostly reversed by applying small currents. A mathematical model of the electrode-tissue system impedance was used to analyze in vivo behavior. The data and modeling results shows that applying charge to the electrode can consistently reduce the impedance of the electrode-tissue system. Analysis of explanted probes suggests that the interaction between the tissue and electrode is dependent on whether chronic pulses were applied. It is hypothesized that the interface between the tissue and metal is altered by current pulsing, resulting in a temporary impedance shift.},

abstract = {A low electrode-electrolyte impedance interface is critical in the design of electrodes for biomedical applications. To design low-impedance interfaces a complete understanding of the physical processes contributing to the impedance is required. In this work a model describing these physical processes is validated and extended to quantify the effect of organic coatings and incubation time. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to electrically characterize the interface for various electrode materials: platinum, platinum black, and titanium nitride; and varying electrode sizes: 1 cm2, and 900 microm2. An equivalent circuit model comprising an interface capacitance, shunted by a charge transfer resistance, in series with the solution resistance has been fitted to the experimental results. Theoretical equations have been used to calculate the interface capacitance impedance and the solution resistance, yielding results that correspond well with the fitted parameter values, thereby confirming the validity of the equations. The effect of incubation time, and two organic cell-adhesion promoting coatings, poly-L-lysine and laminin, on the interface impedance has been quantified using the model. This demonstrates the benefits of using this model in developing better understanding of the physical processes occurring at the interface in more complex, biomedically relevant situations.},

Nanofluidic studies were categorized into two groups depending on the characteristic length scale. When the size of the nanochannels and pores is 5-100 nm, electrostatic interactions are dominant, and ion and fluid flow can be analyzed by continuum dynamics. Various nanofluidic devices were proposed to manipulate aqueous solutions and biomolecules at the nanoscale. The successful development of such systems has major implications for technologies focusing on water purification and processing of complex biological solutions. When the size is less than 5 nm, steric interactions and hydration affect ion and fluid flow, which is analyzed by stochastic and/or molecular dynamics.},

We recently reported the electrokinetic generation of molecular hydrogen from rapidly flowing liquid water microjets [Duffin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2007, 111, 12031]. Here, we describe the use of liquid water microjets for direct conversion of electrokinetic energy to electrical power. Previous studies of electrokinetic power production have reported low efficiencies (3{\%}), limited by back conduction of ions at the surface and in the bulk liquid. Liquid microjets eliminate energy dissipation due to back conduction and, measuring only at the jet target, yield conversion efficiencies exceeding 10{\%}.},

Experiments to establish accuracy are described. These were carried out on four plots of cauliflowers with varying degrees of disruption to the visual scene. The RMS error of vehicle lateral position control was 2- mm, while the RMS error of estimated vehicle position was about 10 mm. Little effect of the disruption on position control was observed. It is concluded that these accuracies would be sufficient to control a vehicle and an associated crop treatment device but that improvements to the vehicle controller would make the control of the treatment device easier.},

abstract = {A direct energy conversion technology based on electrokinetic (EK) phenomenon has attracted an increasing attention during recent years. However, an external driving source (e.g. hydrostatic pressure) is needed to produce an EK flow in microchannels. We recently have developed a novel hybrid energy conversion technique using combined principles of EK and forward osmosis (FO) which directly converts the salinity gradient energy into the electric energy without need of external pressure input. In order to further enhance the power generation efficiency of the FO-EK system, an experimental study is conducted on surface treatment of porous glass (PG) that offers microchannels for EK flow to pass through. The results show that, ultrasonic treatment gives rises to more consistent potential difference and streaming current. SDS surface treatment on PG pretreated by ultrasonic can further enhance EK power generation. In particular, PG treated by ultrasonic and SDS 12 mM yields the best power generation performance with a power density of 3.08 W/m3, an increment of 27.3 {\%} compared to PG without any surface treatment. In addition, the generated potential difference and streaming current linearly increase with the increasing flow rate. Finally, increasing the flow rate gives rise to higher power density increment.},

To evaluate the control system of the prototype vehicle a path consisting of straight lines and left/right turns was constructed. The vehicle was able to follow this path with an error less than 0.3 m in turns and less than 0.2 m following straight lines. The prototype vehicle was constructed in a half year to gain experience with the control and navigation system; using these experiences a new prototype vehicle is under construction.

One of the major efforts of this project is related with working in a natural, complex environment and the similarity between the weeds and the vegetable crop, which makes locating the weeds difficult. The robotic arm presents a parallel structure with six degrees of freedom, and due to its light structure, it is capable of reaching high accelerations. The end-effector has an electrode powered by a set of batteries and kills the weeds by producing an electrical discharge of 15 000 V. All the subsystems of the machine communicate through a controller area network (CAN) bus. There are two vision systems mounted on the machine. The first one is placed at the front of the robot to acquire and analyse field images, in order to detect weeds and send their coordinates to the robotic arm control. The second camera is placed close to the electrode, and its mission is to correct inertial perturbations by relocating every individual weed detected by the first vision system. The successful performance of this new concept of precise non-chemical weeding has been demonstrated in a lettuce crop in Valencia, Spain. (C) 2001 Silsoe Research Institute.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic behavior at the vicinity of a confining wall is closely related to the friction properties of the liquid/solid interface. Here we consider, using molecular dynamics simulations, the electric contribution to friction for charged surfaces, and the induced modification of the hydrodynamic boundary condition at the confining boundary. The consequences of liquid slippage for electrokinetic phenomena, through the coupling between hydrodynamics and electrostatics within the electric double layer, are explored. Strong amplification of electro-osmotic effects is revealed, and the nontrivial effect of surface charge is discussed. This work allows us to reconsider existing experimental data, concerning zeta potentials of hydrophobic surfaces and suggests the possibility to generate "giant" electro-osmotic and electrophoretic effects, with direct applications in microfluidics.},

We show that a finite, two-dimensional, resistor array provides a satisfactory model of the bulk electrolyte, and we identify the complexity required of that resistor array. The electrode-electrolyte interface is modelled in a fashion suitable for commonly-available, compact simulators using a nonlinear extension of the model of Franks (IEEE Trans. Biomed.

The electrode-electrolyte interface model accounts for the nonlinear current-overpotential characteristic and diffusion-limiting effects. We characterise a commercial, implantable, electrode array, fit the model to it, and show that the model successfully predicts subtle operational characteristics.},

abstract = {The strong demand for renewable energy promotes research on novel methods and technologies for energy conversion. Microfluidic systems for energy conversion by streaming current are less known to the public, and the relatively low efficiencies previously obtained seemed to limit the further applications of such systems. Here we report a microdroplet-based electrostatic generator operating by an acceleration-deceleration cycle ('ballistic' conversion), and show that this principle enables both high efficiency and compact simple design. Water is accelerated by pumping it through a micropore to form a microjet breaking up into fast-moving charged droplets. Droplet kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy when the charged droplets decelerate in the electrical field that forms between membrane and target. We demonstrate conversion efficiencies of up to 48{\%}, a power density of 160 kW m(-2) and both high- (20 kV) and low- (500 V) voltage operation. Besides offering striking new insights, the device potentially opens up new perspectives for low-cost and robust renewable energy conversion.},

abstract = {This review investigates the research effort, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, and the associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps. Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and reliable???human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and highly dynamic situation.},

abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics simulation study of the structure and dynamics of water confined between silica surfaces using beta-cristobalite as a model template. We scale the surface Coulombic charges by means of a dimensionless number, k, ranging from 0 to 1, and thereby we can model systems ranging from hydrophobic apolar to hydrophilic, respectively. Both rotational and translational dynamics exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on k characterized by a maximum in the in-plane diffusion coefficient, D||, at values between 0.6 and 0.8, and a minimum in the rotational relaxation time, tauR, at k=0.6. The slow dynamics observed in the proximity of the hydrophobic apolar surface are a consequence of beta-cristobalite templating an ice-like water layer. The fully hydrophilic surfaces (k=1.0), on the other hand, result in slow interfacial dynamics due to the presence of dense but disordered water that forms strong hydrogen bonds with surface silanol groups. Confinement also induces decoupling between translational and rotational dynamics, as evidenced by the fact that tauR attains values similar to that of the bulk, while D|| is always lower than in the bulk. The decoupling is characterized by a more drastic reduction in the translational dynamics of water compared to rotational relaxation.},

abstract = {The design of metal microelectrodes that produce minimal damage to tissue and can successfully record from and stimulate targeted neural structures necessitates a thorough understanding of the electrical phenomena generated in the tissue surrounding the electrodes. Computational modeling has been a primary strategy used to study these phenomena, and the Finite Element Method has proven to be a powerful approach. Much research has been directed toward the development of models for electrode recording and stimulation, but very few models reported in the literature thus far incorporate the effects of the electrode-electrolyte interface, which can be a source of very high impedance, and thus likely a key component of the system. To explore the effects that the electrode-electrolyte interface has upon the electric potential and current density surrounding metal microelectrodes, simulations of electrode-saline systems in which the electrodes were driven at AC potentials ranging from 10 mV to 500 mV and frequencies of 100 Hz to 10 kHz have been performed using the Finite Element Method. Solutions obtained using the thin layer approximation for the electrode-electrolyte interface was compared with those generated using a thin uniform layer, a representation that has previously appeared in the literature. Solutions using these two methods were similar in the linear regime of the interface however, the thin layer approximation has important advantages over its competitor including ease of application and low computational cost.},

abstract = {This paper presents methods, results and analysis for measurements of the electrochemical impedance of platinum electrodes (approximately 0.43 mm2) over a 6-month implantation in the cat cochlea. The study aimed to improve our understanding of the effects of tissue response on impedance behaviour. An increase in impedance in the post-operative period was evident with a rise of the distorted arc at high frequencies in the complex plane, correlating to anomalous charge transport at the electrode-tissue interface. The impedance at low frequencies generally showed a capacitive dispersion modelled as a constant phase element, indicating a blocking characteristic of the electrodes. The study suggests that a reduction and changes in composition of perilymph or extracellular fluid adjacent to the electrodes, as a consequence of tissue response, causes the elevated "contact impedance". This affects the efficiency and quality of neural stimulating electrodes and neural recording electrodes. The finding of the crucial role of perilymph or extracellular fluid thin layer provides a new strategy for surface materials of neural electrodes, which is discussed in the paper. The interface characteristics must be considered during interpretation of studies undertaken in vitro or in acute experiments in vivo, where physiological fluid is abundant.},

However, the induced voltages are typically of the order of a few millivolts, too small for significant power generation. Here we perform tests involving water flow with various molarities of hydrochloric acid (HCl) over few-layered graphene and report order of magnitude higher induced voltages for graphene as compared to nanotubes. The power generated by the flow of 0.6 M HCl solution at 0.01 m/sec was measured to be 85 nW for a 30 16 m size graphene film, which equates to a power per unit area of 175 W/m(2). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the power generation is primarily caused by a net drift velocity of adsorbed Cl(-) ions on the continuous graphene film surface.},

@article{Bechar2017,
abstract = {This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks and operations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widely demonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructured environments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, developments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, structures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performance measures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital for comparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisation and assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and to each task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic environments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low action success rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated into multi-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rate increased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems will enable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on each of these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Research needs to focus on the field use of autonomous or human–robot systems, the latter being a reasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should be suited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.},

The streaming current is observed to be proportional to the pressure gradient and increases with the channel height. As a function of salt concentration, it is approximately constant below10 mM, whereas it strongly decreases at higher salt. Changing the sign of the surface charge is found to reverse the streaming current. The data are best modeled using a nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory that includes the salt-dependent hydration state of the silica surface.},

abstract = {To elaborate on the applicability of the electrokinetic micro power generation, we designed and fabricated the silicon-glass as well as the PDMS-glass microfluidic chips with the unique features of a multi-channel. Besides miniaturizing the device, the key advantage of our microfluidic chip utilization lies in the reduction in water flow rate. Both a distributor and a collector taking the tapered duct geometry are positioned aiming the uniform distribution of water flow into all individual channels of the chip, in which several hundreds of single microchannels are assembled in parallel. A proper methodology is developed accompanying the deep reactive ion etching as well as the anodic bonding, and optimum process conditions necessary for hard and soft micromachining are presented. It has been shown experimentally and theoretically that the silicon-based microchannel leads to increasing streaming potential and higher external current compared to those of the PDMS-based one. A proper comparison between experimental results and theoretical computations allows justification of the validity of our novel devices. It is useful to recognize that a material inducing a higher magnitude of zeta potential has an advantage for obtaining higher power density under the same external resistance.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) consist of wirelessly connected underground sensor nodes that communicate untethered through soil. WUSNs have the potential to impact a wide variety of novel applications including intelligent irrigation, environment monitoring, border patrol, and assisted navigation. Although its deployment is mainly based on underground sensor nodes, a WUSN still requires aboveground devices for data retrieval, management, and relay functionalities. Therefore, the characterization of the bi-directional communication between a buried node and an aboveground device is essential for the realization of WUSNs. In this work, empirical evaluations of underground-to- aboveground (UG2AG) and aboveground-to-underground (AG2UG) communication are presented. More specifically, testbed experiments have been conducted with commodity sensor motes in a real-life agricultural field. The results highlight the asymmetry between UG2AG and AG2UG communication with distinct behaviors for different burial depths. To combat the adverse effects of the change in wavelength in soil, an ultra wideband antenna scheme is deployed, which increases the communication range by more than 350{\%} compared to the original antennas. The results also reveal that a 21{\%} increase in the soil moisture decreases the communication range by more than 70{\%}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that highlights the effects of the antenna design, burial depth, and soil moisture on both UG2AG and AG2UG communication performance. These results have a significant impact on the development of multi-hop networking protocols for WUSNs.},

abstract = {A robotic platform for mapping of weed populations in fields was used to demonstrate intelligent concepts for autonomous vehicles in agriculture which may eventually result in a new sustainable model for developed agriculture. The vehicle presented here is adapted to operate in 0.25 and 0.5 m row crops and equipped with cameras for row guidance and weed detection. A modular approach is taken with four identical wheel modules, allowing four wheel steering and propulsion of the platform. The result is improved mobility which allows parallel displacement of the vehicle during turns by decoupling adjustments in position from adjustments in orientation. Control of the platform is provided through a vehicle electronics and control system based on embedded controllers and standard communication protocols. The software implements a hybrid deliberate software architecture that allows a hierarchical decomposition of the operation. The lowest level implements a reactive feedback control mechanism based on an extension of simple control for car-like vehicles to the four wheel case. The controller design forces the front and rear of the vehicle to follow a pre-determined path and allows the vehicle to maintain a fixed orientation relative to the path. The controller rationale is outlined and results from experiments in the field are presented. ?? 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

However, PDMS swells in the presence of many organic solvents significantly degrading the performance of the device. We present a method to coat PDMS channels with a glass-like layer using sol-gel chemistry. This coating greatly increases chemical resistance of the channels; moreover, it can be functionalized with a wide range of chemicals to precisely control interfacial properties. This method combines the ease of fabrication afforded by soft-lithography with the precision control and chemical robustness afforded by glass.},

abstract = {This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks and operations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widely demonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructured environments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, developments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, structures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performance measures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital for comparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisation and assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and to each task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic environments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low action success rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated into multi-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rate increased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems will enable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on each of these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Research needs to focus on the field use of autonomous or human–robot systems, the latter being a reasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should be suited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.},

The robot employs two vision systems: one gray-level vision system that is able to recognize the row structure formed by the crops and to guide the robot along the rows and a second, color-based vision system that is able to identify a single crop among weed plants. This vision system controls a weeding-tool that removes the weed within the row of crops. The row-recognition system is based on a novel algorithm and has been tested extensively in outdoor field tests and proven to be able to guide the robot with an accuracy of +/-2 cm. It has been shown that color vision is feasible for single plant identification, i.e., discriminating between crops and weeds. The system as a whole has been verified, showing that the subsystems are able to work together effectively. A first trial in a greenhouse showed that the robot is able to manage weed control within a row of crops.},

@article{Sørensen2005,
abstract = {The objective of this study has been to design a number of farm scenarios representing future plausible and internally consistent organic farming enterprises based on milk, pig, and plant production and use these farm scenarios as the basis for the generation of generalised knowledge on labour and machinery input and costs. Also, an impact analysis and feasibility study of introducing innovative technologies into the organic production system has been invoked. The labour demand for the production farms ranged from 6??1 to 25??3 h ha-1 and from 19??4 to 39??6 h LU -1 (LU is livestock units) for work in the animal houses. Model validation results showed that farm managerial tasks amount to 14-19{\%} of the total labour requirement. The impact of introducing new technologies and work methods related to organic farming was evaluated using two innovative examples of weed control: a weeding robot and an integrated system for band steaming. While these technologies increased the capital investment required, the labour demand was reduced by 83-85{\%} in sugar beet and 60{\%} in carrots, which would improve profitability by 72-85{\%} if fully utilised. Profitability is reduced, if automation efforts result in insufficient weed removal compared to manual weeding. Specifically, the benefit gained by robotic weeding was sensitive to the weed intensity and the initial price of the equipment, but a weeding efficiency of under 25{\%} is required to make it unprofitable. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of applying and testing operational models in organic farming systems in the continued evaluation and documentation of labour and machinery inputs. ?? 2005 Silsoe Research Institute.

An analytical model applicable to planar, etched-structure micropumps has been developed. This model consists of pressure and flow relations in addition to an analytical expression that can be used to estimate the thermody- namic efficiency of planar EO pumps. The analytical model was applied to guide the design of a pump consisting of an etched EO flow chamber for near-optimal hydraulic power performance. To achieve high efficiency, the working fluid used was deionized (DI) water with a conductivity of 3.0 10{\^{}}-4 S/m (pH = 5.7). The EO micropump was fabricated on a soda-lime glass substrate using standard microlithography and chemical wet etching techniques. The active pumping volume of the device consists of a wet-etched flow channel 1–mm long in the flow direction and 0.9 mby 38-mm in cross section. The pump performance agrees well with the theoretical model. The pump can produce a maximum pressure of 0.33 atm and a maximum flow rate of 15 L/min min at 1 kV.},

abstract = {The electrode/electrolyte interface impedance can be represented by the parallel combination of a non-faradaic pseudocapacitance and a faradaic, charge transfer resistance. The non-linearity of the overall electrode/electrolyte interface impedance is largely due to that of the faradaic resistance which is derived from the Butler-Volmer equation. As the charge transfer resistance dominates the interface impedance at low frequencies, it is in this region that non-linearities are first observed. The voltage limit of linearity has been investigated and found to increase gradually for higher frequencies. Although relatively linear compared with the charge transfer resistance, the non-faradaic impedance becomes non-linear at large applied voltage amplitudes and dominates the high-frequency non-linear behaviour of the overall interface impedance. Mid-frequencies are affected by a combination of the faradaic and non-faradaic non-linearities.},

The numerical results show flow circulations generated from the induced non-uniform zeta potential distribution along the conducting hurdle surfaces. It is demonstrated that the local flow circulations provide effective means to enhance the flowmixing between different solutions. The mixing enhancement effect is experimentally validated using PDMS based microchannels with embedded platinum hurdles. The dependence of the degree of mixing enhancement on the hurdle geometries and hurdle numbers is also predicted.

Sensors include global positioning systems (GPS), machine vision, dead-reckoning sensors, laser-based sensors, inertial sensors and geomagnetic direction sensors. Computational methods for sensor information are used to extract features and fuse data. Planners generate movement information to supply control algorithms. Actuators transform guidance information into changes in position and direction. A number of prototype guidance systems have been developed but have not yet proceeded to commercialization. GPS and machine vision fused together or one fused with another auxiliary technology is becoming the trend development for agricultural vehicle guidance systems.

The long-range nature of the interactions, such as the exact distance dependence of the force laws plays only a minor role. This chapter investigates in detail the interactions between spheres and particles whose radii are much larger than interatomic spacings. The chapter lists the most common forces encountered between macroscopic particles and extended surfaces interacting in liquids. It also summarizes the special features of different interactions. The chapter illustrates some commonly occurring intermolecular and intersurface potential functions and the different effects they can have on molecule–molecule and particle–particle interactions. The chapter relates the pair potentials between small molecules to those between molecules and surfaces, and between large particles of different geometries. The chapter also explains in detail the concepts related to size effects on interparticle interaction potentials, surface-area-to-volume scaling effects, and dynamic and nonequilibrium effects.},

abstract = {The background to the development of a two-wheel drive agricultural gantry system, its assessment and evolution into a commercial machine are described. Details of the main frame, transmission, implement attachment linkages and vehicle control systems are discussed and their performance assessed. Soil and crop responses to gantry systems are presented. A minimum power-to-weight ratio of 15 Kw/t is recommended for adequate performance. To maintain vehicle stability, the ratio of the weight on the drive wheels to that on the undriven castor wheels should not exceed 75:25. Up to 70{\%} tillage energy savings can be made by removing all traffic from the cultivated area and plough resistance may be reduced by up to 50{\%}. Conventional traffic on the soil increases aggregate size and reduces porosity compared with zero traffic operations. The yield of spring barley in 1991 on a clay soil was increased by around 0{\textperiodcentered}75 t/ha under zero compared with conventional traffic, confirming a similar winter wheat yield response in 1990. It is concluded that suitably engineered gantries are able to carry out most operations on a farm and that they offer significant advantages over existing tractor systems in many aspects of their operation. The effect of improved boom stability on chemical applications needs to be quantified as well as the precise bout matching made possible by gantry systems.},

This work is an attempt to apply a control technique combining a neural network (NN) and a genetic algorithm (GA). A NN is applied to describe the motion of the agricultural mobile robot as a nonlinear system because it is able to identify the dynamics of complex systems with its high learning ability. To create a path using a simulator described by the NN, a GA, which is inspired by biological evolution and uses a process of variation and selection to search a solution space, is utilized as an optimization method. Using this simulator and the GA, the time series of the steer angles, which were the control input, were optimized, and consequently an optimal work path of the mobile robot was created. The technique explored here should be applicable to a wide variety of nonlinear control problems in agriculture. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Applying robotics in plant production requires the integration of robot capabilities, plant culture, and the work environment. Commercial plant production requires certain cultural practices to be performed on the plants under certain environmental conditions. Some of the environmental conditions are mostly natural and some are modified or controlled. In many cases, the required cultural practices dictate the layout and materials how of the production system, Both the cultural and environmental factors significantly affect when, where and how the plants are manipulated. Several cultural practices are commonly known in the plant production industry. The ones which have been the subject of robotics research include division and transfer of plant materials in micropropagation, transplanting of seedlings, sticking of cuttings, grafting, pruning, and harvesting of fruit and vegetables. The plants are expected to change their shape and size during growth and development. Robotics technology includes many sub-topics including the manipulator mechanism and its control, end-effector design, sensing techniques, mobility, and workcell development. The robots which are to be used for performing plant cultural tasks must recognize and understand the physical properties of each unique object and must be able to work under various environmental conditions in fields or controlled environments. This article will present some considerations and examples of robotics development for plant production followed by a description of the key components of plant production robots. A case study on developing a harvesting robot for an up-side-down single truss tomato production system will also be described.},

abstract = {The competition between streaming potential effect and hydrodynamic slip effect in pressure-driven microchannel flows is elucidated. The treatment is performed analytically in the framework of the Debye–H{\"{u}}ckel linear approximation and the Navier slip boundary condition. As compared with pressure- driven flows in nonslip microchannels, pressure-driven flows in microchannels with hydrodynamic slippage are found to experience severer flow reduction (streaming potential effect). An apparent viscos- ity ratio is also defined to identify the competition between streaming potential effect and hydrodynamic slip effect in pressure-driven microchannel flows. It is shown that the streaming potential effect predom- inates when this ratio is larger than unity and the slip effect predominates when this ratio is smaller than unity. More importantly, we derive a formula for the critical slip length which provides a guideline for designing hydrophobic surfaces over which the effect of hydrodynamic slip exactly counteracts that of streaming potential. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {We investigate theoretically the influence of hydrodynamic slip at the surface of a nanofluidic channel on the efficiency with which electrokinetic phenomena can be used to convert hydrostatic energy to electrical power. Slip is introduced by applying the Navier boundary condition to the pressure-driven and the electro-osmotic components of the fluid velocity. A strong enhancement in the efficiency is predicted for increasing slip length due to the resulting decrease in the fluidic impedance and increase in the streaming conductance. These effects are moderated by a decrease in the electrical impedance, which promotes dissipation. The maximum efficiency approaches 100{\%} as the slip length diverges, and a potentially practical 40{\%} efficiency is expected for a moderate 30 nm slip length in a 10 nm high channel. Recently reported slip lengths for carbon nanotube filters suggest that efficiencies above 70{\%} and high power densities might be achieved in a graphitic system.},

So, the natural frequencies for each used membrane is determined and then, applying a flow ramp with a rate sufficiently small, the streaming potential can be obtained from the slope of the pressure values versus electrical potential. The determination of the electric potential inside the pores, $\phi$, requires to solve the Poisson–B{\"{o}}ltzmann equation in the case of membranes with pore diameter in the range of thickness, for which the radial components of velocity of the fluid must be considered. Since there is no analytical solution, a numerical method was used to obtain $\phi$. The electrical potential value at a distance equal to hydrodynamic radius from pore axis (zeta potential) is used to evaluate the streaming potential by the Helmholtz–Smoluchowsky relation. These values were compared with the experimental data accomplishing the suitable iterations over the surface charge density until coincidence. The values of the surface charge density for the studied membranes show a concentration dependence described by Lang- muir's model for the greatest pore diameters and Freundlich's model for the smallest pore diameters. {\textcopyright}1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Using a Surface Forces Apparatus we have measured changes in the electrical potential difference between quartz and mica surfaces that correlate with the changing quartz dissolution rate when surfaces are pressed together at relatively low pressures (2-3 atm) in aqueous electrolyte solutions of 30 mM CaCl2 at 25 C. No detectable dissolution or voltage potential difference is measured in symmetrical systems (e.g. mica-mica or quartz-quartz) or between dry surfaces subjected to similar pressures, indicating that the dissolution can not be attributed to a simple pressure effect, slow aging (creep), or plastic deformation of the quartz surface. In quartz-mica systems brought together under pressure or to close proximity in electrolyte solution, the onset of quartz dissolution is marked by a sudden, rapid decrease in the quartz thickness at initial rates in the range from 1 to 4 nm/min, which after several hours settles into a constant rate of approximately 0.01 nm/min ({\~{}}5 mum/yr). Concomitantly, the potential drops to a constant value once the dissolution rate has stabilized. The decrease in the decay rate is interpreted as being due to saturation of the confined aqueous film and/or to the buildup of a Stern layer on the quartz surface, and the constant rate as being due to the steady-state chemical dissolution and diffusion of the dissolving silica into the surrounding reservoir. The dissolution is `non-uniform': the surfaces become rough as dissolution proceeds, with the appearance of pits in a manner analogous to corrosion. On occasions, the process of rapid dissolution followed by a gradual transition to steady dissolution repeats itself, suggesting that the pit structure and Stern layer are fragile and subject to collapse and/or expulsion from the gap. Preliminary experiments on the dissolution of multi-faceted milled quartz particles ({\~{}}1.0 mum diameter) compressed between two muscovite surfaces suggest an asymmetry in the dissolution rates at different crystallographic planes. The origin of the electrical potential is interpreted as arising from the overlapping of the electric double-layers of two dissimilar surfaces when they are forced into close proximity. This electrical potential difference, for as yet unknown reasons, appears to be the driving force for the dissolution, rather than pressure.},

abstract = {The dispersion and absorption of a considerable number of liquid and dielectrics are represented by the empirical formula$\epsilon$*−$\epsilon$∞=($\epsilon$0−$\epsilon$∞)/[1+(i$\omega$$\tau$0)1−$\alpha$]. In this equation, $\epsilon$* is the complex dielectric constant, $\epsilon$0 and $\epsilon$∞ are the ``static'' and ``infinite frequency'' dielectric constants, $\omega$=2$\pi$ times the frequency, and $\tau$0 is a generalized relaxation time. The parameter $\alpha$ can assume values between 0 and 1, the former value giving the result of Debye for polar dielectrics. The expression (1) requires that the locus of the dielectric constant in the complex plane be a circular arc with end points on the axis of reals and center below this axis. If a distribution of relaxation times is assumed to account for Eq. (1), it is possible to calculate the necessary distribution function by the method of Fuoss and Kirkwood. It is, however, difficult to understand the physical significance of this formal result. If a dielectric satisfying Eq. (1) is represented by a three‐element electrical circuit, the mechanism responsible for the dispersion is equivalent to a complex impedance with a phase angle which is independent of the frequency. On this basis, the mechanism of interaction has the striking property that energy is conserved or ``stored'' in addition to being dissipated and that the ratio of the average energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle is independent of the frequency.},

It is found that electroosmotic pumping efficiency can exceed mechanical pumping efficiency when the width of capillary elements become small. Computations show that electric power generation with an efficiency of approximately 17 percent may be obtained by pumping water through fine capillary media.},

@article{Shellock2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) issues (magnetic field interactions, MRI-related heating, and artifacts) for a wirelessly powered lead used for spinal cord stimulation (SCS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed, wirelessly powered lead (Freedom-4, Stimwave Technologies Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) underwent evaluation for magnetic field interactions (translational attraction and torque) at 3 Tesla, MRI-related heating at 1.5 Tesla/64 MHz and 3 Tesla/128 MHz, and artifacts at 3 Tesla using standardized techniques. MRI-related heating tests were conducted by placing the lead in a gelled-saline-filled phantom and performing MRI procedures using relatively high levels of radiofrequency energy. Artifacts were characterized using T1-weighted, spin echo (SE), and gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences.

RESULTS: The lead exhibited minor magnetic field interactions (2 degree deflection angle and no torque). Heating was not substantial under 1.5 Tesla/64 MHz (highest temperature change, 2.3°C) and 3 Tesla/128 MHz (highest temperature change, 2.2°C) MRI conditions. Artifacts were moderate in size relative to the size and shape of the lead.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that it is acceptable for a patient with this wirelessly powered lead used for SCS to undergo MRI under the conditions utilized in this investigation and according to other necessary guidelines. Artifacts seen on magnetic resonance images may pose possible problems if the area of interest is in the same area or close to this lead.},

@article{Damez2007,
abstract = {The electrical properties of biological tissues have been researched for many years. Impedance measurements observed with increasing frequencies are mainly attributed to changes in membrane conductivity and ion and charged-molecule mobility (mainly Na+, K+, CL- ions). Equivalent circuits with passive electrical components are frequently used as a support model for presentation and analyses of the behavior of tissues submitted to electrical fields. Fricke proposed an electrical model where the elements are resistive and capacitive. The model is composed of a resistive element (Rp) representing extracellular fluids (ECF) placed in parallel with a capacitive element (Cs) representing insulating membranes in series and a resistive element (Rs) representing intracellular fluids (ICF). This model is able to describe impedance measurements: at lower frequencies, most of the current flows around the cells without being able to penetrate them, while at higher frequencies the membranes lose their insulating properties and the current flows through both the extracellular and intracellular compartments. Since meat ageing induces structural change, particularly in membrane integrity, the insulating properties of membranes decrease, and intracellular and extracellular electrolytes mix, thus driving changes in their electrical properties. We report a method combining the Fricke and Cole-Cole models that was developed to monitor and explain tissues conductivity changes in preferential directions during beef meat ageing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
