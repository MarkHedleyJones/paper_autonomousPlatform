\begin{abstract}
    Horticultural robots designed for in-field use generally require a means of transport around farms or orchards.
    A common approach is to directly integrate a drive system at the expense of increasing overall complexity.
    Alternatively, the robots can be modularised and attached to general purpose platforms.
    General purpose platforms reported previously are designed to carry relatively light payloads orientated toward ground based crops.
    This paper presents a modularised platform capable of carrying modules of up to \SI{1000}{\kilo\gram} under \SI{1.5}{\meter} high pergola style kiwifruit canopies.
    Sensors suitable for autonomous navigation are evaluated in-orchard and tested using a prototype navigation algorithm.
    It is found that GNSS based navigation is not feasible under kiwifruit canopies, but perception based navigation sees the platform complete a number of block traversals unassisted.
    The design of the vehicle's structure, drive system, and software architecture is discussed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}
    Short-term labor requirements within New Zealand's kiwifruit industry peak twice a year corresponding with the pollination and harvesting of kiwifruit.
    The majority of employment during these peaks is filled by seasonal or casual workers \citep{Timmins2009}.
    As kiwifruit is the country's largest horticultural export by value \citep{StatisticsNewZealand2015}, effective automation in this industry will promote economic growth.
    Development of an automated kiwifruit harvesting system with an integrated drive system has previously been published \citep{Scarfe2012}.
    That work presented a platform designed to autonomously navigate though pergola style kiwifruit orchards and had four integrated harvesting arms.
    Work presented here focuses on creating a platform that operates independently from orchard related tasks, such as fruit harvesting and pollination.
    Utilisation of a base platform will be increased by allowing it to be used during harvesting \emph{and} pollination seasons.
    Details of modules developed for use on the platform will be published separately.
    These modules have been built as part of a larger project focusing on automation in kiwifruit orchards.

    Automated kiwifruit harvesting and pollination demands computer control, state-of-the-art manipulators, and machine-vision systems.
    Such systems are bulky and have specific geometric requirements dictated by the environment they operate in.
    Both share the need for electrical power, air pressure, and a means of locomotion.
    However, they differ in the way they move when operating.
    The pollinating module moves at a well-known speed with minimum changes in angle.
    This differs from the harvesting module that advances a set distance between stationary harvest cycles.
    To enable the whole system to work autonomously, the base platform must be able to self-drive in a way appropriate for these modules.

    While publishing details of BoniRob, a general purpose robotics platform for field use, the authors stated that ``since the robot development already includes a high complexity, the application itself should be of comparably low complexity'' \citep{Ruckelshausen2009}.
    By separating the development of the platform from other task-specific modules, the risk of a single part becoming overly complex is reduced.

    The development of autonomous vehicles in agriculture is not new, but much of the literature relates to manned vehicles converted to drive-by-wire.
    Because the canopy of a pergola style kiwifruit orchard can droop as low as \SI{1.4}{\meter} to the ground under fruit loading, most standard vehicles are not suited to this environment.
    Many autonomous vehicles designed for use in orchards, such as vineyards, rely on satellite navigation for guidance.
    The dense foliage of a kiwifruit canopy and the surrounding shelter-belts make receiving Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals unreliable at best.
    This means the vehicle must navigate through its environment using perception based sensors.
    Seven requirements have been identified for the platform's use with the pollination and harvesting modules in kiwifruit orchards.
    These are to:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item support a mass of \SI{1000}{\kilo\gram},
        \item fit under a \SI{1.4}{\meter} high ceiling,
        \item self-navigate through test orchard blocks,
        \item provide \SI{8}{\kilo\watt} of electrical power to modules,
        \item turn between rows within the headland areas,
        \item include a bin-lifting mechanism for carrying fruit bins, and
        \item provide a module mounting area no more than \SI{400}{\milli\meter} from the ground.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sect:review}

        The introduction of computers and digital camera technology during the 1980s sparked research into autonomous vehicles for agricultural use \citep{Li2009}.
        When publishing details of an autonomous vehicle in 1998, Tillett et~al.\@ cite difficulties dealing with variability in lighting and the environment as the reason no commercial vehicles were available at the time \citep{Tillett1998}.
        Their vehicle combined wheel encoders, a compass, and accelerometers for odometry information.
        It also featured a camera based row guidance system.
        The system as a whole was capable of spraying individual plants whilst driving autonomously at \SI{0.7}{\meter\per\second} (\SI{2.5}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}).
        While their purpose built experimental vehicle proved capable of row following and targeted spraying, it was not designed for modularity.


        Four years later, two autonomous vehicles designed for weed mapping and control in open field crops were presented \citep{Pedersen2002,Astrand2002}.
        These platforms had relatively simple chassis and drive systems as they were both at a prototype stage, i.e., neither were designed to carry heavy payloads.
        The first vehicle, presented by Åstrand \& Baerveldt, featured: two-wheel steering, two-wheel drive, a camera based row guidance system, batteries, a combustion engine, and an air compressor.
        While its appearance resembled that of a computer server rack on wheels, it contained most of the components required of a platform for use with modularised fruit harvesting and pollination modules.
        The second unit, described by Pedersen et~al.\@, was four-wheel drive with two-wheel steering and used GPS as its primary navigation sensor.
        It was battery powered only and lacked any sort of row guidance sensor or power generation unit.
        The authors found that row-crop based navigation from GPS alone was not practical and proposed the integration of a row guidance sensor in their next design.
        They also proposed a revised drive system with four wheel steering and a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus for low-level system communication as opposed to using serial links.

        Two years later, the revised design proposed by \cite{Pedersen2002} was presented by \cite{Bak2004}.
        Its drive system was modularised with four identical drive/steering modules mounted to the chassis for locomotion.
        This revised chassis featured a three-point suspension system that ensured all four wheels stayed in contact with the ground.
        The system also incorporated the row guidance sensor as proposed in earlier work, as well as a Real-Time Kinematic enabled GPS receiver (RTK-GPS), fibre optic gyroscope, compass, and wheel encoders.
        The authors noted that the control strategy for the four independently controlled wheels was non-trivial.
        While much more developed than the previous work of \cite{Pedersen2002}, the platform was not designed to: carry heavy payloads, operate in the absence of satellite navigation, or power itself beyond its battery capacity.

        In 2009, details of BoniRob were published by \cite{Ruckelshausen2009}.
        Similar to the previous unit presented by \cite{Bak2004}, it featured a gyroscope, an RTK-GPS receiver, a CAN bus for communication, and four-wheel steering.
        It introduced the use of both single-plane and multi-layer laser range scanning, known as lidar, for perception and row detection.
        A \SI{2.8}{\kilo\watt} petrol engine could be mounted to the chassis, additional to its on-board batteries.
        It was capable of carrying a \SI{150}{\kilo\gram} payload in its dedicated module space, which happens to be the gross weight of the vehicle presented by \cite{Bak2004}.
        What made BoniRob particularly interesting is its ability to alter its track width by actuating the arms to which its wheels were attached.
        Like the robots before it, BoniRob was designed for use on open field crops.
        During the previous year, some of these authors published details of a much simpler robot named `Weedy' \citep{Klose2008}, also an open field crop based sensing platform.
        BoniRob represents the first of the more general purpose platforms designed to carry modularised payloads.


        Most recently, \cite{Bawden2017} published details of their field crop robot -- Agbot~II.
        For locomotion it uses two driven wheels in a differential drive configuration with castor wheels for support.
        It is battery powered and designed to autonomously return to a shipping container with a built-in solar powered charging station.
        The vehicle is made of two side modules bridged by a modular centrepiece containing instrumentation.
        Side modules contain the drive system, whereas the centrepiece is designed to be specific to the application.
        As with all of the vehicles previously reviewed, its payload carrying capabilities are limited to ground facing modules for inspection, weeding, or spraying of field crops.


        Of particular relevance is the earlier work of Scarfe et~al.\@ on an autonomous kiwifruit picking robot \citep{scarfe2009, Scarfe2012}.
        That work involved the creation of a hydraulically driven platform, with two-wheel steering and four-wheel drive, to which four fruit harvesting arms and a bin lifting mechanism were integrated.
        While that platform was designed to navigate through kiwifruit orchards autonomously, its ability to do so was not tested due to an outbreak of \textit{Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae} (PSA) that closed access to kiwifruit orchards.
        The platform had a petrol engine and made use of camera and lidar based row guidance sensors.
        It had sufficient carrying capacity, however it lacked the modularity of a general purpose platform, meaning it could only be used to harvest kiwifruit.

        With the exception of the platform presented by \cite{Scarfe2012}, all of the reviewed platforms are designed for open field crops.
        None were designed for harvesting operations and therefore were not capable of carrying bins.
        Referring back to the statement from \cite{Ruckelshausen2009} that ``the application itself should be of comparably low complexity'', one can see why research thus far has focused on simpler tasks such as inspection or weeding.
        However, once designs move past these applications it becomes necessary to accommodate other shared requirements.
        A fork lifting mechanism is general enough that most orchard related tasks can benefit from it.
        For example, with a harvesting module mounted it can be used to hold a bin in which harvested fruit is collected.
        With a pollination module mounted it can hold the tank of liquid pollen solution.
        The ability to pick up a standard pallet has broad applications in and around orchards too.

        \cite{Blackmore2007} envisaged significant reductions in production costs for agricultural robotics by repurposing parts already in use in the agricultural and automotive industry.
        High-power AC motor controllers are one such component which are increasingly being used by automotive manufacturers.
        Significant cost reductions are possible by using controllers designed for integration by automotive manufacturers as opposed to more general purpose controllers.
        While not a physical component, the CAN bus is another example of technology borrowed from the automotive industry.
        Most of the more recent platforms made use of this for low-level communication.

        With regards to the use of RTK based GNSS guidance, Slaughter et~al.\@ points out the trade-off of requiring an ``unobstructed `view' of the sky from all parts of the field'' \citep{Slaughter2008}.
        \cite{Durrant-Whyte2005} describe one failure mode of GPS being multipath signal propagation caused by nearby foliage or the geometry of the land itself.
        \cite{Li2009} conclude that the use of either GPS and machine vision, or GPS and lidar will become a development trend.
        Based on the increased reception requirements, we discount the use of RTK based systems, but still consider the use of general purpose GNSS receivers as a navigation input.

\section{Platform Design}
\label{sect:design}
        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/profile_views/AMMP-All-Labelled.pdf}
            \caption{Profile drawings of the robotic platform with kiwifruit bin.}
            \label{fig:AMMP}
        \end{figure}

        The vehicle's design is mostly influenced by the need to carry modularised robotic systems and fruit bins.
        Existing commercial platforms suitable for use in horticulture exist, such as the Warthog from ClearPath Robotics, but the maximum payload, battery life, and vehicle geometry make it and similar offerings unsuitable.
        The mass of modules for pollination or harvesting can be as much as \SI{600}{\kilo\gram} and a bin of kiwifruit adds an additional \SI{400}{\kilo\gram}.
        The canopy height in these orchards ranges from \SI{1.4}{\meter} to \SI{1.7}{\meter} so the vehicle must have a low profile.
        Modules carried by the platform require clearance from the canopy in addition to the height they occupy themselves.
        To maximise the space available to these modules the platform must be low-slung at the point they attach.
        Figure~\ref{fig:AMMP} illustrates the platform's design, with module area allocated between markers `G' and `H' in the side view (top left).
        The top surface of the chassis in this region sits \SI{360}{\milli\meter} above the ground.

        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{imgs/profile_views/AMMP-Chassis-1-20.pdf}
            \caption{Drawing of the vehicle's chassis showing front pivot mechanism and steering linkages. The laser-cut and folded structure has a total mass of \SI{190}{\kilo\gram}.}
            \label{fig:AMMPChassis}
        \end{figure}

        The chassis is assembled from sections of \SI{3}{\milli\meter} laser-cut and folded mild steel.
        The sections are welded together on jigs, also made from laser-cut and folded steel, before being powder coated.
        Much of the folded chassis structure contains triangular cut-outs, reducing weight while having minimal impact on rigidity.
        Finite element analysis was used during the design phase to help identify areas needing to be strengthened and areas where material could be removed.
        This helped to ensure the platform meets its target load capacity of \SI{1000}{\kilo\gram}, while the structural chassis weighs only \SI{190}{\kilo\gram}.
        A drawing of the structural chassis is shown as Figure~\ref{fig:AMMPChassis}.

        Lifting forks occupy the area between the rear wheels.
        The lifter is actuated by two vertically mounted double acting pneumatic cylinders (SMC CP96D100-320) and is controlled by a standard pneumatic valve block.
        Each cylinder is capable of exerting \SI{4700}{\newton} at \SI{600}{\kilo\pascal} or \SI{6300}{\newton} at \SI{800}{\kilo\pascal}.
        Fuel and compressed air tanks sit over the right-hand rear wheel as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:suzy}.

    \subsection{Steering}
    \label{sub:steering}

        The angles of the vehicle's front wheels are actuated independently following the Ackermann steering geometry principle.
        Actuation is performed by brushless AC motors (Heinzmann PSM G100) mounted vertically above each drive wheel.
        These motors can generate \SI{7.32}{\newton\meter} of torque with a maximum angular velocity of \SI{3000}{rev\per\minute} and are rated at \SI{2.3}{\kilo\watt}.
        Their outputs are fed through fixed-ratio planetary gearboxes with a 64:1 reduction, increasing torque to \SI{470}{\newton\meter} while reducing the maximum angular velocity to \SI{47}{rev\per\min}.

        Torque requirements for the steering motors are based on a static friction scenario with the vehicle loaded with a \SI{1000}{\kilo\gram} mass, sitting on concrete.
        This is represented by:
        \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:steer_torque}
        \tau = W u \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{8} + E^2}
        \end{equation}
        where $\tau$ is the torque required to break static friction, $W$ is the force transmitted through a wheel, $u$ is the coefficient of friction, $B$ is the nominal width of the tyre, and $E$ is the offset between the tyre's contact surface and its axis of rotation.
        The axis of rotation on the vehicle lies directly through the centre of the tyre, meaning $E=0$.
        % As the axis of steering rotation lies directly through the centre of the wheel, $E=0$.
        A value of 0.75 was used as the coefficient of friction as a best guess representation of a tractor-grip tyre on dry concrete.
        The mass of the vehicle (\SI{800}{\kilo\gram}), plus payload (\SI{1000}{\kilo\gram}), and fuel (\SI{60}{\kilo\gram}) adds to \SI{1860}{\kilo\gram}.
        Allowing for uneven weight distribution on the vehicle and a safety margin, the per wheel mass supported is \SI{500}{\kilo\gram}, or a weight of \SI{4900}{\newton}.
        The width of the tyres is \SI{0.28}{\meter}.
        Combining these values in Equation~\ref{eqn:steer_torque} yields a torque of \SI{388}{\newton} to overcome static friction when actuating the steering motors.

        Actuating the wheels independently removes the need for mechanical linkages between them, allowing for more extreme steering angles and a simpler mechanical design.
        Both steered wheels have the freedom to rotate \SI{330}{\degree}, artificially limited by mechanical stops.
        At the tightest steering angle of \SI{90}{\degree}, the centre-point of the turn is located at the midpoint of the rear wheels.
        The turning radius in this case is roughly equal to the vehicle's wheelbase.
        This sees the vehicle turn between adjacent rows spaced as little as \SI{3}{\meter} apart.

        Implementing a four-wheel steering system would shift the pivot point to the vehicle's centre, roughly halving the turn radius, but this was deemed unnecessary.
        Headlands in kiwifruit orchards are sized for tractors with much larger turning radii than the developed platform so there is plenty of space for turning.
        Use of a two-wheeled steering system removes the need to develop the ``non-trivial'' control strategies encountered by \cite{Bak2004}.
        It also increases the usable area at the rear of the vehicle by removing the need for clearances around actuated wheels.
        A skid steer system was expected to cause ground damage to a level considered unacceptable to orchard owners when carrying heavy loads.

        The steering motors have incremental encoders, but no means of absolute positioning built-in.
        This means the front wheel angles must aligned before use.
        A homing sequence at boot-up is used to find an absolute angle as a reference for incremental data.
        Inductive proxy sensors are used as a means of detecting the position of the wheels during the homing sequence.

    \subsection{Drive system}
    \label{sub:drive}

        A three point suspension system ensures all wheels remain in contact with the ground.
        This is realised with a front pivoting axle, which can be seen in  Figure~\ref{fig:AMMPChassis}.
        As the operating speed for the vehicle is \SI{1.39}{\meter\per\second} (\SI{5.0}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}), the tyres were expected to provide sufficient capacity for shock absorption.

        Performance requirements for the vehicle's traction system during up-hill acceleration while under load were calculated as follows:
        \begin{align}
        \label{eqn_f_rolling}
        F_{rolling} &= C_{rr} \times m\\
        F_{grade} &= m \times G \times \sin(\alpha)\\
        F_{accel} &= m \frac{\Delta v}{t}\\
        \label{eqn_f_accel}
        F_{total} &= F_{rolling} + F_{grade} + F_{accel}
        \end{align}
        Where $F_{rolling}$ is the force due to rolling resistance; $F_{grade}$ is the grade (or incline) force; and $F_{accel}$ is the force required for mass acceleration.
        A rolling resistance coefficient ($C_{rr}$) of 0.04 was chosen based on values found in automotive handbooks.
        It represents the case of a pneumatic tyre on medium-hard soil.
        Other variables used are: a vehicle mass ($m$) of \SI{1900}{\kilo\gram}, slope angle ($\alpha$) of \SI{20}{\degree}, velocity change ($\Delta t$) of \SI{2.78}{\metre\per\second} (\SI{10}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}), and an acceleration time ($t$) of \SI{6}{\second}.
        Putting these values through Equations \ref{eqn_f_rolling}--\ref{eqn_f_accel} gives a total force requirement of \SI{7.99}{\kilo\newton}.
        On a per wheel basis this is \SI{2.0}{\kilo\newton}, or \SI{729}{\newton\meter} when taking the wheel radius ($r$) of \SI{0.365}{\meter} into account.
        Required traction power ($P$) is then calculated as follows:
        \begin{align}
        \label{eqn_f_power}
        \omega &= 2 \pi \times \frac{v}{2 \pi r} = \frac{v}{r}\\
        P &= \tau \omega
        \end{align}
        where $\omega$ is the angular velocity of a wheel, $v$ is the vehicle velocity, and $\tau$ is torque.
        At a velocity of \SI{2.78}{\meter\per\second} (\SI{10}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}), the calculations give a power requirement of \SI{5.55}{\kilo\watt} per wheel.

        The selected motors are hub-mounted permanent magnet brushless AC motors with integrated 40:1 fixed-radio planetary gearboxes (Heinzmann PSM-G120).
        Each motor is rated for \SI{6.4}{\kilo\watt} at \SI{96}{\volt} with a maximum angular velocity of \SI{3000}{rev\per\min} and a torque of \SI{20.4}{\newton\meter}.
        At the output of the gearbox, the torque jumps to \SI{816}{\newton\meter} while the angular velocity drops to \SI{75}{rev\per\minute}.
        This gives the platform a top speed of \SI{10.3}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}.

        In total there are seven brushless AC motors on-board the platform: four drive motors, two steering motors, and a motor used for electrical power generation.
        Each are connected to individual AC motor controllers (Sevcon Gen4 DC Size 4).
        These controllers are available in four bus voltage options: 24-36V, 36-48V, 72V-80V, and 96V-110V.
        The six motors used for traction and steering are together capable of consuming \SI{30.2}{\kilo\watt}.
        With a \SI{48}{\volt}DC bus this would equate to a current draw of \SI{630}{\ampere}.
        As \SI{24}{\meter} of cabling is required to connect the motors and controllers to a common point on the vehicle, a \SI{96}{\volt}DC bus was used to reduce the required gauge of that cable.


    \subsection{Power Distribution}
    \label{sub:power}
        The system bus connects the batteries and generator to motor controllers and on-board power converters.
        A series of heavy-duty contactors (TE Connectivity Kilovac LEV200) control each device's connection to the bus, as well as the bus's connection to the power source.
        Figure~\ref{fig:power_system_diagram} illustrates the distribution of power on the platform.

        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/system_diagram/full-system-diagram_v1.pdf}
            \caption{Power distribution system diagram. Dashed lines in grey indicate control lines to contactors.}
            \label{fig:power_system_diagram}
        \end{figure}

        Two battery modules attached to the sides of the chassis each house fifteen lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO$_{\text{4}}$) batteries connected in series.
        Together, the batteries (Winston/Thundersky WB-LYP90AHA) provide a nominal bus voltage of \SI{96}{\volt} and a total electrical capacity of \SI{8.64}{\kilo\watt\hour}.
        The battery packs were `bottom-balanced' before being fitted and no cell-level voltage monitoring is present.
        Maximum and minimum pack voltages were established by monitoring individual cells during charging and discharging.
        At the point that any individual cell exceeds a safe maximum/minimum threshold, the respective maximum/minimum pack voltage is determined.

        A hermetically sealed disconnect switch (Gigavac HBD41) separates the batteries from the system.
        Once closed, an auxiliary \SI{24}{\volt} bus becomes active that powers components required to bring the rest of the rest on-line.

        A power generation unit comprised of a petrol engine (Honda GX-690), air compressor (Rotorcomp NK-1), and electrical generator is housed at the front of the vehicle.
        The drive shafts of these units are connected via pulleys and a heavy-duty timing belt.
        The engine, compressor, and alternator are controlled and monitored by a micro-controller based control board.
        This board connects to the Platform PC via the system CAN bus.
        The engine is capable of producing \SI{16}{\kilo\watt}, where up to \SI{9.6}{\kilo\watt} is converted to electrical power, limited in software, and \SI{4.0}{\kilo\watt} is converted to pneumatic power.
        The system maintains a pneumatic tank pressure of \SIrange{600}{800}{\kilo\pascal}.

        Electrical generation is done with a brushless AC motor/generator (Heinzmann PMSG-150) connected to the same model of motor controller used with the drive system.
        This motor is a larger variant of those used for traction and steering, but with no gearbox fitted.
        Its controller is configured only to have regenerative braking functionality.
        This configuration allows the system to control the power output by adjusting the braking effort required from the controller.
        The controllers offer configuration of battery voltage and current limits as well as the ability to reduce output effort as the battery voltage approaches its maximum.
        These settings provide all the functionality of a general purpose lithium-ion battery charger, making this a cost effective charging solution.
        Electrical energy from the power generation unit is fed to the batteries in a series-hybrid configuration.
        An external charging port is also fitted to allow charging of the batteries without using the petrol engine.

        A fuel tank is fitted over the rear right-hand wheel, visible in Figure~\ref{fig:suzy}.
        It can hold \SI{60}{\litre} of petrol, allowing the vehicle to operate continuously for over \SI{24}{\hour}.
        On-board DC-DC converters deliver \SI{2.8}{\kilo\watt} at \SI{12}{\volt}DC, \SI{3.8}{\kilo\watt} at \SI{24}{\volt}DC, and \SI{3.5}{\kilo\watt} at \SI{240}{\volt}AC, simultaneously.
        A connection panel at the front of the dedicated module area houses the weather-sealed plugs through which these outputs are accessible.


    \subsection{Communications Architecture}
    \label{sect:architecture}

        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/system_diagram/diagram_v5.pdf}
            \caption{
                Communications level system diagram showing types of links between devices.
                Devices on right-hand side of the serial link are mechanically integrated into the vehicle, whereas those on the left are modular and can be removed.
            }
            \label{fig:system_diagram}
        \end{figure}

        The platform is centrally controlled by an x86 based small-form-factor PC (Intel NUC) running Ubuntu 16.04 server edition, referred to as the ``Platform PC''.
        This computer communicates with most sub-systems via a CAN bus interfaced using a USB adaptor (IXXAT USB-to-CANV2).

        A second, externally mounted, computer is responsible for higher level control of the vehicle.
        It is used to connect to navigation sensors, send drive commands to the platform, and perform processing tasks relevant to autonomous navigation.
        It too is an x86 based PC running Ubuntu, but uses a commodity microATX form-factor motherboard with a discrete graphics card (Nvidia GTX 1080).
        The graphics card is used to accelerate neural network algorithms and some image processing functions.
        An Ethernet network connects this PC to mounted modules and sensors, whereas a direct serial connection is used to communicate with the Platform PC.
        Figure~\ref{fig:system_diagram} illustrates how these devices are linked together.

        In addition to the drive commands generated by the Navigation PC, a wireless controller (HBC Radiomatic Eco) lets the operator issue drive commands via joystick.
        The receiver module contains relays that are directly controllable from the remote control.
        All inputs from this controller are also broadcast on the CAN bus and read by software nodes on the Platform PC.
        The remote control has two joystick inputs, two selector switches, four buttons, and an emergency stop switch.
        The emergency stop switch is connected to the \SI{96}{\volt} bus contactor via relay outputs from the receiver unit.
        If this switch is closed during operation, or the controller goes out of range, power to the bus is cut within \SI{500}{\milli\second}.
        This engages the mechanical park brakes, removes all tractive effort from the motor controllers, and de-powers mounted modules.

        The open source Robotic Operating System (ROS) is used to facilitate communication between computers and software nodes running within each computer.
        Nodes written using this framework follow either a publish-subscribe or service-client pattern depending on the application.
        To maximise code reusability, each device on the platform has its own ROS node dedicated to publishing device data or subscribing to generated device commands.
        Interface adapters, motor controllers, wireless controllers, lidar, and encoders are such devices with dedicated interface nodes.
        Nodes are also used to transform or perform calculations on data while passing it between nodes written in either C++ or Python.
        For instance, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:system_diagram_software}, an `Ackermann kinematics' node transforms steering input data into individual wheel velocity and position/angle outputs.
        Among other things, ROS offers the ability to monitor and record all communication passing through it which can be replayed at a later date.

        A manufacturer's configuration of the motor controllers require them to be interfaced using a combination of analogue and digital inputs.
        For example, the accelerator and steering inputs are controlled by potentiometers actuated by the vehicle's driver.
        However, the controllers also provide an option for a multi-motor vehicle configuration.
        In this configuration, inputs fed into a master controller are relayed to a second controller over a CAN interface.
        This interface is configured using a proprietary tool and is not intended for use other than between controllers configured with their software.
        By observing the communication protocol between a master and slave in operation, it was possible to implement a master node in software that runs on the Platform PC.
        With this, all motor controllers on the platform are programmed as slave devices.
        This forces them to accept drive commands via CAN interface, allowing them to be directly controlled by ROS nodes.

        Relay modules allow the Platform PC to toggle power to on-board power supplies, motor controllers, park-brakes, and lights.
        They also monitor the timing of synchronisation messages transmitted by the Platform PC onto the CAN bus.
        These synchronisation messages are configured to occur every \SI{20}{\milli\second} as an indication that the system is running as expected.
        Once a relay module detects an absence of these messages for \SI{100}{\milli\second} or longer it enters an error state.
        This causes the motor controllers and on-board power supplies to be shut-off and the park-brakes to be engaged.
        Synchronisation message monitoring is used as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the system is promptly shut-down if the Platform PC fails.

        The open source simulation package Gazebo was used to simulate the vehicle's steering geometry with input from a game-pad.
        This revealed issues that were resolved before implementation on the physical hardware.
        It also provided the opportunity to tune control parameters, such as steering sensitivity, while reducing the time to test.

\section{Navigation Sensor Selection}
\label{sect:sensors}
    The choice of sensors incorporated into a vehicle determines which algorithmic approaches are available for navigation and object detection.
    The use of lidar, cameras, and GNSS receivers have been considered.
    Each sensor's ability to capture relevant data is evaluated by in-orchard trials.

    Other sensors considered for inclusion are outlined in Table \ref{table:sensor_comparison} along with their associated issues.
    Factors considered were the strengths and weaknesses in the context of orchard use, reported usage in literature, and availability at a suitable price.
    A review of previous works highlighted both lidar and 2D cameras as offering high functionality for navigation and object detection.
    Time-of-flight cameras are a compelling option based on a cost-benefit analysis; especially if cheaper units work outdoors in the presence of sunlight.
    Because localisation is such a key function, the performance of two GNSS receivers has also been evaluated.

    \begin{table}[htbp]
        \centering
        \footnotesize
        \begin{tabular}{ l l}

            \textbf{Sensor Type}      &\textbf{Common Issues} \\ \hline

            Thermal Camera            & Reduced visibility in conditions of low thermal contrast\\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Sensor types considered for inclusion on the platform.}
        \label{table:sensor_comparison}
    \end{table}

    As the drive motors have built-in wheel encoders, basic odometry data is already available.
    Encoders on driven wheels will give false readings if wheel slip occurs so are not be used for odometry alone.
    However, the data provided can still be used to assist with mapping, localisation, and provide velocity feedback.


    \subsubsection{In-orchard Camera Evaluation}
        \label{sect:camera_evaluation}

        Three types of camera were tested: time-of-flight, 3D stereoscopic, and traditional 2D cameras.
        Smaller platforms (Clearpath Husky and Adept MobileRobots Pioneer P3-AT) were used to gather data used for evaluation.
        Cameras were mounted \SI{0.8}{\meter} above the ground, roughly mid-way between the ground and the canopy, facing forward.

        The time-of-flight camera was a Basler TOF640-20GM-850NM.
        It provides range, intensity, and confidence data at a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels.
        This specific model was chosen as it had previously proved useful when collecting depth data of kiwifruit canopies.
        During that time it had been operated under a range of lighting conditions and exhibited minimal occurrences of data loss.
        In those conditions the camera was mounted with its principal axis aligned vertically, pointing upwards to the canopy.
        However, subsequent testing with the camera mounted with its principal axis aligned horizontally revealed significant data loss in both sunny and overcast conditions.
        This is thought to be the result of two factors.
        The first is a lower reflectivity of objects in view of the camera when facing forwards, as opposed to facing up at a leafy canopy.
        The second is due to a dramatic increase in distance between the camera and the scene's subject matter.
        As the camera relies on active illumination of the scene, its ability to detect that illumination amongst ambient light will drop sharply with distance.

        The 3D stereo camera tested was an Intel RealSense R200.
        It combines a stereo pair of infrared cameras with a colour camera.
        Additionally, it features an infrared projector as a means of adding texture to objects in its field of view to assist with stereo processing.
        The appealing characteristics of this sensor were its low cost and its claim of being long-range and able to work outdoors.
        However, in both overcast and sunny conditions it suffered from a \emph{complete} loss of range data.
        This appeared to be the result of ambient light interfering with the infrared projector’s signal.

        Traditional, 2-dimensional, cameras trialled were the Basler Dart daA1600-60uc, Flir CM3-U3-13S2C-CS, and a Logitech C920 web-camera.
        The Logitech C920 suffered from significant motion blur that, being a consumer grade web-camera, was not surprising.
        It also lacked the functionality of a hardware trigger and sent images with significant latency, measured at \SI{150}{\milli\second}.
        The Basler and Flir cameras both produced images of sufficient quality and featured hardware triggering.
        The Basler camera had a USB3 interface and an average image transfer time of \SI{14}{\milli\second}.
        The Flir camera had a USB2 interface and an average image transfer time of \SI{65}{\milli\second}.
        The Basler offering was favoured for its later model image sensor, simpler software interface, and lower-latency.

        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/camera_comparison/camera_comparison.pdf}
            \caption{
                Example images captured from trialled 2D cameras.

            }
            \label{fig:canopyDataCloud}
        \end{figure}

        Both the time-of-flight and 3D stereoscopic camera systems were deemed unsuitable based on the occurrences of data loss.
        Images from the industrial 2D cameras (from Basler and Flir) were deemed suitable for object detection and classification.
        This was verified by processing the data using readily accessible detection algorithms such as convolutional neural networks.
        Using a pair of these 2D cameras it is also possible to build a stereoscopic pair.
        This provides the same functionality of the 3D stereoscopic camera from Intel, but without requiring the infrared projector.
        Stereo pairs of industrial cameras have since proven useful on modularised harvesting and pollination modules for localising fruit and flowers, but were not tested for row navigation.


    \subsubsection{In-orchard Lidar Evaluation}
        Three lidar were evaluated, two single-plane and one multi-layer.
        The two single-plane lidar were the Hokuyo UTM-30LX and a SICK LMS111.
        The multi-layer lidar is a Velodyne VLP-16 which has 16 horizontal \SI{360}{\degree} planes spread over \SI{15}{\degree} vertically.
        Data was collected from each lidar by driving through orchard rows with the sensor placed \SI{0.8}{\meter} above ground level.
        Data was captured both on the presented platform and the smaller robots used to collect camera data.

        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/canopy_data/canopy_data.pdf}
            \caption{
                Data captured from a single plane lidar showing non-structural points reflected by the canopy (indicated by red markers) and structural points from tree trunks and posts (blue markers).
                The arrow indicates the position and heading of the platform at the time of capture.
            }
            \label{fig:canopyDataCloud}
        \end{figure}

        The intention was to use lidar as a means of detecting structure defining features of the orchard, such as posts, trunks and hedges.
        Detecting these features should allow for row boundary detection and general mapping and localisation.
        However, both single-plane lidar produced clouds of unstructured data amongst the structured features, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:canopyDataCloud}.
        This was caused by the lidar scan plane intercepting with the canopy whilst driving over convex terrain.
        Similarly this issue arose on concave terrain where the plane intercepted with the ground, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:concaveSlope}.

        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/concave_slope/concave_slope_v4.pdf}
            \caption{
                On concave slopes the lidar scan plane intercepts with the ground instead of trunks or posts.
                The dashed line shows a horizontal plane coming from the the lidar.
                Dotted lines represent the upper and lower layers taken from the multi-layer lidar.
            }
            \label{fig:concaveSlope}
        \end{figure}

        This issue was reduced by the use of a multi-layer lidar and post-processing.
        Having sixteen layers available meant it was possible to select a scan layer that gives the most useful viewing range.
        Referring again to Figure~\ref{fig:concaveSlope}, that would correspond to the dotted line above the horizontal (dashed) line which intercepts with a row defining feature (a tree trunk).

        It was decided that a multi-layer lidar would be best suited for navigation due to its ability to to see more distant features while driving on undulating ground.
        A single-plane lidar could still be used at short range as an independent channel of processing for redundancy or obstacle detection.

    \subsubsection{In-orchard GNSS Evaluation}
        Two GNSS receivers were evaluated: a Ublox Neo-M8N module and an OmniSTAR 5120VBS with AX0 series antenna.
    	Both were connected to a single board computer (Beaglebone Black) via serial connection.
        The Ublox module was selected for its high sensitivity and internal low-noise amplifier.
        It is capable of receiving GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou GNSS signals concurrently.
        The OmniSTAR receiver was chosen for its external high-gain antenna (34 dB) which claims multi-path rejection.
        It is capable of receiving only GPS signals.

        The testing procedure first involved planning a path through a single row of a kiwifruit orchard and plotting this on a satellite map.
        The receivers were then tested separately over the course of approximately two hours by walking them along the planned path.
        Before testing, each unit was powered up and given \SI{30}{\minute} to initialise in an open area near the kiwifruit orchard.
        During testing, each unit was walked slowly along the predetermined path with stops at each waypoint to provide time for a positional fix.
        The path was approximately \SI{500}{\meter} in length and took approximately \SI{15}{\minute} to complete, including stops at each waypoint.
        Waypoints were spaced at intervals of \SI{5.5}{\meter} along the row.

        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \centering
            \includegraphics{imgs/gps_path/gps_path.pdf}
            \caption{
                Aerial view of the path taken through the test orchard and the captured GPS data.
                Dashes representing the approximate path are spaced at intervals of \SI{5.5}{\meter}.
            }
            \label{fig:gpsResults}
        \end{figure}

        The path followed, together with coordinates collected from the receivers, are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:gpsResults}.
        It should be noted that data has been recorded for the round-trip so represents two passes along the path.
        It was noticed during testing that the signal quality lights on both receivers regularly indicated a loss of signal.

        The Omnistar unit appears to track the approximate path well, but the data is sparse with regular loss of signal after entering the orchard.
    	The Ublox unit collected more data, but was much less accurate.
        It may be possible to use a unit such as the Omnistar, which provided fewer but more accurate readings, as a sanity check for an approximate location within orchards.
        Overall, the units could not be relied on for localisation in this environment.
        These results indicate GNSS receivers with similar performance to those trialled are unsuitable for use in kiwifruit orchards.


\section{Autonomous Block Traversal}
\label{sect:autonomous}
    Two row following strategies were developed for implementation on the platform.
    Further details and results of each have been published separately.
    One method used multi-layer lidar to detect the trunks and posts of the orchard and follow a centre-line between them \citep{Bell2016}.
    The second method used a single camera combined with a convolutional neural network to segment parts of the image.
    These features were traversable space, tree-lines, and row-ends \citep{Bell2017}.
    A centreline was then fitted to the areas marked as traversable and used to generate a control vector.

    Both algorithms were developed on smaller, commercially available, test platforms while the target platform was under construction.
    A laptop (Dell E6410) with integrated graphics processor (Nvidia M5000M) was used on those platforms to process sensor data and generate drive vectors.
    Both approaches produced paths that led to reproducible row following behaviour.
    A method of conducting row-end turns was trialled on the Pioneer 3-AT robot using the lidar based approach.
    However, the platform's drive system lacked the power required to turn into rows on uphill slopes.

    To determine when the vehicle was at the end of a row, the multi-layer lidar was used to detect the absence of canopy in a volume above the front and to the sides of the vehicle.
    The camera based method was unable to detect this end-of-row condition which is necessary for initiating the turn.
    It also lacked the ability to locate obstacles which is important on the target platform due to its size and power.
    Finally, the lidar based approach required much less computational power to achieve similar performance.
    While it would be possible to combine the approaches, only the lidar based method was adapted for use on the target platform.

    Differences in the geometry meant adjustments were needed when implementing on the target platform.
    The multi-layer lidar was mounted horizontally above the front-right steering motor, visible in Figure~\ref{fig:suzy} and later in Figure~\ref{fig:suzy_turning}.
    The smaller platforms used a skid-steer geometry, whereas the target platform uses an Ackermann geometry.
    This means that when turning, a skid-steered platform pivots along a lateral axis passing midway between the front and rear wheels.
    On the target platform, that axis instead passes through the rear axle.
    The software was modified to account for the change in pivot axis and mounting location of the lidar.

    \begin{figure}[htb]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/turning_diagrams/flowchart.pdf}
        \caption{
            Flow-chart of the developed autonomous block traversal algorithm.
        }
        \label{fig:turn_diagram}
    \end{figure}

    Figure~\ref{fig:turn_diagram} depicts the steps taken when traversing a block, including execution of the row-end turns.
    The multi-layer lidar is used to detect whether the vehicle is \textit{in\_row} or \textit{out\_of\_row} based on the presence of canopy.
    A row-end turn sees the platform execute a series of turn-segments which have previously been tuned for the specific row and direction of turn.
    Initially, a template set of turn-segments is executed at each row's end while under observation.
    If the vehicle gets too close to obstacles or nearby boundaries during execution, the operator would intervene before collision occurs.

    A row end turn can contain any number of segments, with each representing a turn vector and distance that must be covered before proceeding.
    Once the operator intervenes, he/she will tweak relevant parameters of the turn.
    This can be widening or tightening as well as lengthening or shortening the distance of the segment.
    Finally, if an object is detected in the vehicle's path during a turn, the steering is automatically adjusted to avoid the object.
    This happens independently from the parameters contained in the map file.
    Figure~\ref{fig:suzy_turning} shows the platform performing a row-end turn while under autonomous control.

\section{Testing}
\label{sub:testing}

  \subsection{Mass Loading}
    Structural integrity testing was carried out by loading a \SI{1100}{\kilo\gram} mass to the vehicle's module area.
    No deflection of the vehicle's chassis structure was evident upon application of the test mass.
    Deflection of approximately \SI{1.5}{\milli\meter} was measured between the front pivot and the wheel supports.
    % \begin{figure}[htb]
    %     \centering
    %     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/photos/stopTesting.jpg}

    %         Stop testing down a \SI{10}{\degree} slope with a \SI{1100}{\kilo\gram} mass strapped to the module area.
    %     }
    %     \label{fig:suzy_testing}
    % \end{figure}
    Static steering tests conducted on a dry concrete surface showed no reduction in ability to turn while supporting the test mass.
    Dynamic tests involved three instances of stopping whilst driving down a \SI{10}{\degree} slope at a speed of \SI{10}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}.
    During each test the vehicle came to a complete stop within \SI{2.0}{\meter}.

  \subsection{Turning Circle}

    Measurement of the vehicle's turning radius were performed at speeds of \SI{5.0}{\kilo\meter\per\hour} and \SI{10.0}{\kilo\meter\per\hour} on both dry tarmac and damp grassland.
    These speeds were calculated at the mid-point between the two front wheels, at the centre of the pivot.
    Having a wheelbase of \SI{2.67}{\meter}, these turning speeds of equate to angular velocities of \SI{0.520}{\radian\per\second} and \SI{1.04}{\radian\per\second} respectively.

    In each case, a line was drawn on the ground in front of the vehicle to mark its starting position.
    The vehicle was then turned through an angle of \SI[separate-uncertainty=true]{180(10)}{\degree} under manual control with the steering angle set at \SI{90}{\degree}.
    The final angle was adjusted using odometry information to ensure the total angle was within \SI[separate-uncertainty=true]{180(3)}{\degree}.
    A marker was then drawn on the ground at the front of the vehicle at this position.
    The distance between the markers was measured at \SI{6.45}{\meter} for both surface types and at both test speeds.
    This gives a turning radius of \SI{3.23}{\meter}.

  \subsection{Bin Lifter}

    Testing of the bin lifting mechanism was done using a mass mounted to a wooden pallet.
    The total mass, including the pallet was approximately \SI{370}{\kilo\gram}.
    The test was performed by manually activating a valve block until the pallet sat \SI{250}{\milli\meter} above the ground.
    To raise the load, pneumatic pressure of \SI{800}{\kilo\pascal} was applied to one port of each double acting cylinder while the other port was opened to atmosphere.
    Lowering was done by simply opening both ports to atmosphere, allowing the load to descend under its own weight.
    The test load was lifted and lowered a total of five times.
    A drivability test was also made, which saw the vehicle driven for \SI{300}{\meter} which included an \SI{8}{\degree} incline for \SI{30}{\meter}.

    The lifting capacity of the mechanism was sufficient to raise the load gently to its target height.
    At its lower position, signs of imbalance between the two cylinders was evident which caused shuddering.
    The shuddering was due to excessive and unmatched static friction on each side of the four-bar mechanism caused by overly tight sleeve bearings.
    This behaviour was also evident when hand actuating the lifter.
    During the drivability test the load dropped by between \SIrange{60}{70}{\milli\meter} from its initial height.
    This drop and variation in resting position was caused by static friction in the mechanism and vibrations whilst driving.

  \subsection{Turning Between Rows}

    Two orchards were used for row-turn testing, where a single block was used at each.
    These blocks are referred to as Block A and Block B.
    Block A was \SI{1.15}{\kilo\meter} in total traversable length spread over 10 rows, while Block B was \SI{670}{\meter} in total traversable length spread over 9 rows.
    After tuning of the row end turning manoeuvres, the platform navigated Block A consecutively 7 times.
    Figure~\ref{fig:block_traversal_bateman} shows the number of interventions per traversal while under tuning in Block A, 19 traversals in total.
    After tuning the row end turns in Block B, it was navigated 3 times consecutively.
    Figure~\ref{fig:block_traversal_newnham} shows the number of interventions per traversal while under tuning in Block B, 10 traversals in total.
    % This equates to a total of \SI{10}{\kilo\meter} of successfully navigated orchard rows.

    \end{figure}

        }
        \label{fig:block_traversal_newnham}
    \end{figure}

    The key weakness of the current navigation system is the need to tune the row end turns manually for each site.
    The tuning required for the first orchard block amounted to eight traversals of the entire block.
    For the second block, seven complete traversals were required for tuning.
    This creates a significant resource overhead for deployment to any new sites.
    If the row end turns are not sufficiently tuned, two failure cases may occur.
    The most common case is that the vehicle turns through a row end too tightly or not tightly enough and the object avoidance system is not sufficiently responsive to avoid a collision.
    All but four interventions were due to an imminent collision with a post during a row end turn.
    Three interventions during row end turning were due to the platform trying to recommence row following before facing the new target row.
    In this case the most feasible path for row following was detected through the headland area, instead of the target row.
    One intervention, attempt 12 of Block A, was caused by the canopy detection system triggering a row-end turn mid-row.

  \subsection{Row Following}
    Row following repeatability tests were made by running the vehicle down the same row for a total of five runs.
    Each run saw the vehicle start from a position marked out on the grass using pegs.
    A custom row following algorithm was used to guide the vehicle through the row, and also stopped the vehicle once it detected it was near the end of the row.
    Specific implementation details of the algorithm are sensitive, but test results from its use are presented.
    The tests were conducted at \SI{1.39}{\meter\per\second} (\SI{5}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}) in each case, i.e., the row following algorithm controlled only the steering angle and the stopping position.

    To determine the vehicle's trajectory, recordings of the lidar and IMU were made which where run through a SLAM package offline.
    The SLAM package used was Google Cartographer (version 1.0) used as a ROS package that produced both the map and the trajectory information \citep{Hess2016}.
    % The maps and tradjectories were exported from RVIZ as images, which were then post-processed using a vector graphic program (Inkscape version 0.91).
    % The tradjectories were traced and measured using the program's built-in path-length measurement tool.

    \end{figure}

    Figure \ref{fig:row_following_paths} shows the resulting orchard map and five trajectories overlaid on top of each other.
    While differences in start position are estimated to be less than \SI{0.1}{\meter}, the trajectories show a spread in the initial position by as much as \SI{0.44}{\meter}.
    Table \ref{table:row_follow_path_lenghts} lists the total path lengths, and Figure \ref{fig:row_following_end_points} shows the spread of resting positions.
    The maximum displacement between resting positions is \SI{0.56}{\meter}.

    An interesting point occurs approximately one-third of the way through each run where the paths diverge briefly.
    This location is visible in Figure \ref{fig:row_following_paths} in the enlarged box that shows the divergence.
    Replaying the captured sensor data through the row-following algorithm revealed a cluster of transient points at the edge of the row.
    These points, most likely the result of weeds, interfered with the localisation of a single post due to their close proximity.
    The algorithm uses the positions of these posts to determine row centre-points, which was unstable at this location.

    Wheel odometry provided by the drive motors was not used during row following as signs of slippage were apparent.
    Quick measurements conducted on grass showed that an imbalance of approximately \SI{5}{\percent} between the rear wheels depending on the slope angle (which was not measured).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sect:discussion}

    The reported platform achieves the requirements outlined during the introduction and has proved its usefulness during two pollination and harvesting seasons.
    However, during these operations the vehicle was primarily operated under manual control.
    This was due to the need to control the vehicle outside of its autonomous operating behaviour.
    In most cases it was driven as close as possible to a row's edge on two passes through each row.
    This was needed to give mounted modules access to the full canopy area whilst performing their tasks.
    The need to drive close to row boundaries was a consequence of limitations with the separately developed modules.

    The results from testing of navigation algorithms indicate that the multi-layer lidar with wheel encoder feedback are sufficient for row following tasks.
    The method for turning between rows calls for further work.
    Row end turning was a manual process that involved observing an autonomously driven turn and manually adjusting the length or radius of the turn's segments.
    Future work will focus on enabling the system to plan row-end turns based on sensor data, without a manually created map.

    During installation and testing of the platform's electrical system, the \SI{96}{\volt} battery pack introduced a significant electrical hazard.
    While essential for safety, risk mitigation procedures added complexities and delays that could have been avoided by selecting a lower pack voltage.
    The authors suggest a pack voltage of \SI{48}{\volt} as a safer alternative during vehicle development as it bears a reduced risk of injury from electric shock.
    Inputs of \SI{48}{\volt} are supported across a wider range of motors, motor controllers, and power converters, but cabling requirements are increased.
    The benefit of using a lower gauge of cable has not outweighed the extra safety procedures required.

    The series-hybrid configuration allows the vehicle to drive and provide power to subsystems without running the petrol engine.
    This is useful in testing scenarios, where people are in close proximity to the vehicle, as it eliminates exhaust fumes and reduces noise and vibration.
    However, robotic modules and the bin lifting mechanism require pneumatic air pressure to operate.
    As the air compressor is belt driven from the petrol engine, it is necessary to frequently run the engine to provide air to these systems.
    An electric air compressor would allow the system to run unassisted by the petrol engine for much longer periods.
    The authors suggest that efficiency losses from frequently running the engine to maintain pneumatic pressure outweigh conversion losses associated with running an electric air compressor.

    The use of more general purpose platforms to test navigation algorithms enabled the navigation system to be developed in parallel with the physical hardware.
    Their smaller size eliminated the risk of serious injury and led to a speed up in development and test cycles.
    It also meant that navigation testing could continue while the platform was engaged in other activities.

    Simulation of the robot hardware proved useful for finding software issues before implementation on hardware.
    Most of the time spent developing the simulation went into the creation of a geometric model of the platform.
    This model has also proved useful for visualising the state of the vehicle, using Rviz, in real-time or when replaying recorded sensor data.
    For instance, it is possible to display the angle of the front steering wheels based on encoder feedback while the platform is being driven.
    It is also possible to place a lidar in the model and have the point-cloud data displayed in the vehicle's coordinate frame.

\section{Conclusion}
    This work presented a platform designed specifically for autonomous driving through pergola style kiwifruit orchards.
    The platform is capable of carrying modules with twice the mass of than those previously reported in the literature.

    Multi-layer lidar proved to the most versatile sensor for navigation in general, owing to its wider field of view.
    One particularly useful aspect was the ability to detect the presence of canopy above the vehicle.
    Using a map of manually adjusted row-end turns, the platform has navigated over \SI{10}{\kilo\meter} of orchard blocks using wheel encoders and a single multi-layer lidar.
    A significant amount of work was required to tune the row end turns, which has implications for commercial deployment.

    During development, a \SI{48}{\volt} battery pack was identified as being ideal for development vehicles of this size due to safety and component availability.
    The use of smaller, commercially available, robots were valuable as a means to develop navigation software before deployment on full scale platforms.
    Future work will focus on improving turns between rows.
    This will involve developing a system whereby the vehicle can plan its own turns without the need for manual tuning.
