abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a method that is able to create a suboptimal path of an agricultural mobile robot. This work is an attempt to apply a control technique combining a neural network (NN) and a genetic algorithm (GA). A NN is applied to describe the motion of the agricultural mobile robot as a nonlinear system because it is able to identify the dynamics of complex systems with its high learning ability. To create a path using a simulator described by the NN, a GA, which is inspired by biological evolution and uses a process of variation and selection to search a solution space, is utilized as an optimization method. Using this simulator and the GA, the time series of the steer angles, which were the control input, were optimized, and consequently an optimal work path of the mobile robot was created. The technique explored here should be applicable to a wide variety of nonlinear control problems in agriculture. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Barraquand1992,
abstract = {We propose a new approach to robot path planning which consists of incrementally building a graph connecting the local minima of a potential function defined in the robot's configu- ration space and concurrently searching this graph until a goal configuration is attained. Unlike the so-called "global" path planning methods, this approach does not require an expensive computation step before the search for a path can actually start. On the other hand, it searches a graph that is usually much smaller than the graph searched by the so-called "local" methods. We describe a collection of specific techniques that allow to engineer various implementations of our path planning approach. The purpose of these techniques is to (1) construct "good" potential fields and (2) ef- ficiently escape their local minima (i.e., efficiently build the local minima graph). They are based on the use of multiscale pyramids of bitmap arrays for representing both the robot's workspace and configuration space. This distributed representation makes it possible to construct potential fields numerically, rather than analytically, in relation to other efficient numerical techniques. We have implemented these techniques in a path planner, which turns out to be both very fast and capable of handling many degrees of freedom. The planner has solved a variety of problems. Some of them are far beyond the capabilities of previously existing planners. Acknowledgements:},

abstract = {A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) was developed for autonomous operation of a speed sprayer in an orchard. The operation of the FLC was graphically simulated under the real condition of the orchard. Machine vision was used to determine vehicle heading and four ultrasonic sensors were used to detect obstacles during the operation. Operation time duration of the hydraulic cylinders was inferred as output of the FLC. The results of simulation showed that the speed sprayer could be operated autonomously by the FLC that used sensor inputs from machine vision and ultrasonic sensors. After the graphic simulation, autonomous speed sprayer operation in a real orchard was conducted using the developed FLC. Orchard image analysis and signals of ultrasonic sensors were processed in real time. The speed sprayer was modified to be steered by two hydraulic cylinders. The results of field test showed that the speed sprayer could be operated by the FLC. The ultrasonic sensors didn't contribute to the improvement of guidance performance; however, they assisted the speed sprayer to avoid trees or obstacles in emergent situations.},

abstract = {The off-road machine industry is transitioning from electric- and hydraulic-assisted technologies to computer-assisted technologies. The main enabler for this transition is the use of a communication network embedded on the machine. This often doubles the electrical complexity and cost of the on-board electronics for the machine. However, the value of built-in diagnostics and monitoring of important machine features offsets the added cost and complexity of the electronics. Once this network and architecture is in place, there is opportunity for adding control features, enhanced diagnostics, and specialty sensors that can create significant value to the machine with a minimum of added cost. This paper will describe the types of sensors used for four principle roles on a machine. The sensors' specific requirements will be compared by use. Often the accuracy requirements for a sensor increase by nearly an order of magnitude between monitoring functions and control and diagnostics functions. This paper discusses the state of the art for the use of sensors in off-road machines from a life-cycle perspective ranging from emerging to mature usage needs.},

abstract = {This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks and operations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widely demonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructured environments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, developments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, structures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performance measures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital for comparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisation and assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and to each task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic environments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low action success rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated into multi-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rate increased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems will enable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on each of these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Research needs to focus on the field use of autonomous or human–robot systems, the latter being a reasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should be suited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.},

abstract = {In the Motion Planning research field, heuristic methods have demonstrated to outperform classical approaches gaining popularity in the last 35 years. Several ideas have been proposed to overcome the complex nature of this NP-Complete problem. Ant Colony Optimization algorithms are heuristic methods that have been successfully used to deal with this kind of problems. This paper presents a novel proposal to solve the problem of path planning for mobile robots based on Simple Ant Colony Optimization Meta-Heuristic (SACO-MH). The new method was named SACOdm, where d stands for distance and m for memory. In SACOdm, the decision making process is influenced by the existing distance between the source and target nodes; moreover the ants can remember the visited nodes. The new added features give a speed up around 10 in many cases. The selection of the optimal path relies in the criterion of a Fuzzy Inference System, which is adjusted using a Simple Tuning Algorithm. The path planner application has two operating modes, one is for virtual environments, and the second one works with a real mobile robot using wireless communication. Both operating modes are global planners for plain terrain and support static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Multirobot path planning is difficult because the full configuration space of the system grows exponentially with the number of robots. Planning in the joint configuration space of a set of robots is only necessary if they are strongly coupled, which is often not true if the robots are well separated in the workspace. Therefore, we initially plan for each robot separately, and only couple sets of robots after they have been found to interact, thus minimizing the dimensionality of the search space. We present a general strategy called subdimensional expansion, which dynamically generates low dimensional search spaces embedded in the full configuration space. We also present an implementation of subdimensional expansion for robot configuration spaces that can be represented as a graph, called M*, and show that M* is complete and finds minimal cost paths.},

abstract = {Aside from aerodynamic and gravitational forces, all other major forces and moments affecting the motion of a ground vehicle are applied through the running gear–ground contact. An understanding of the basic characteristics of the interaction between the running gear and the ground is, therefore, essential to the study of performance characteristics, ride quality, and handling behavior of ground vehicles. The running gear of a ground vehicle is generally required to fulfill the following functions: • to support the weight of the vehicle • to cushion the vehicle over surface irregularities • to provide sufficient traction for driving and braking • to provide adequate steering control and direction stability. Pneumatic tires can perform these functions effectively and efficiently; thus, they are universally used in road vehicles, and are also widely used in off-road vehicles. The study of the mechanics of pneumatic tires therefore is of fundamental importance to the understanding of the performance and char-acteristics of ground vehicles. Two basic types of problem in the mechanics of tires are of special interest to vehicle engineers. One is the mechanics of tires on hard surfaces, which is essential to the study of the characteristics of road vehicles. The other is the mechanics of tires on deformable surfaces (unprepared terrain), which is of prime importance to the study of off-road vehicle performance.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {Safe robot navigation in tree fruit orchards requires that the vehicle be capable of robustly navigating between rows of trees and turning from one aisle to another; that the vehicle be dynamically stable, especially when carrying workers; and that the vehicle be able to detect obstacles on its way and adjust its speed accordingly. In this paper we address the latter, in particular the problem of detecting people and apple bins in the aisles between rows. One of our requirements is that the obstacle avoidance subsystem shouldn't add to the robot's hardware cost, so as to keep the acquisition cost to growers as low as possible. Therefore, we confine ourselves to solutions that use only the sensor suite already installed on the robot for navigation-in our case, a laser scanner, low-cost inertial measurement unit, and steering and wheel encoders. Our methodology is based on the classification and clustering of registered 3D points as obstacles. In the current implementation, obstacle avoidance takes in 3D point clouds collected in apple orchards and generates an off-line assessment of obstacle position. Tests conducted at our experimental orchard-like environment in Pittsburgh and an actual apple orchard in Washington state indicate that the method is able to detect people and bins located along the vehicle path. Stretch tests indicate that it is also capable of dealing with objects as small as 15 cm tall as long as they aren't covered by grass, and to detect people crossing the aisles at walking speed.},

abstract = {The objective of this study has been to design a number of farm scenarios representing future plausible and internally consistent organic farming enterprises based on milk, pig, and plant production and use these farm scenarios as the basis for the generation of generalised knowledge on labour and machinery input and costs. Also, an impact analysis and feasibility study of introducing innovative technologies into the organic production system has been invoked. The labour demand for the production farms ranged from 6??1 to 25??3 h ha-1 and from 19??4 to 39??6 h LU -1 (LU is livestock units) for work in the animal houses. Model validation results showed that farm managerial tasks amount to 14-19{\%} of the total labour requirement. The impact of introducing new technologies and work methods related to organic farming was evaluated using two innovative examples of weed control: a weeding robot and an integrated system for band steaming. While these technologies increased the capital investment required, the labour demand was reduced by 83-85{\%} in sugar beet and 60{\%} in carrots, which would improve profitability by 72-85{\%} if fully utilised. Profitability is reduced, if automation efforts result in insufficient weed removal compared to manual weeding. Specifically, the benefit gained by robotic weeding was sensitive to the weed intensity and the initial price of the equipment, but a weeding efficiency of under 25{\%} is required to make it unprofitable. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of applying and testing operational models in organic farming systems in the continued evaluation and documentation of labour and machinery inputs. ?? 2005 Silsoe Research Institute.

abstract = {possibility to move from the initial position to the final position (target). The proposed path finding strategy is designed in a grid-map form of an unknown environment with static unknown obstacles. The robot moves within the unknown environment by sensing and avoiding the obstacles coming across its way towards the target. When the mission is executed, it is necessary to plan an optimal or feasible path for itself avoiding obstructions in its way and minimizing a cost such as time, energy, and distance. The proposed path planning must make the robot able to achieve these tasks: to avoid obstacles, and to make ones way toward its target. The algorithms are implemented in Borland C++, afterwards tested with visual basic and DELPHI programming language; whereby the environment is studied in a two dimensional coordinate system. The simulation part is an approach to the real expected result; this part is done using C++ to recognize all objects within the environment and since it is suitable for graphic problems. Taking the segmented environment issued from C++ development, the algorithm permit the robot to move from the initial position to the desired position following an estimated trajectory using visual basic and Delphi language.},

abstract = {A robotic platform for mapping of weed populations in fields was used to demonstrate intelligent concepts for autonomous vehicles in agriculture which may eventually result in a new sustainable model for developed agriculture. The vehicle presented here is adapted to operate in 0.25 and 0.5 m row crops and equipped with cameras for row guidance and weed detection. A modular approach is taken with four identical wheel modules, allowing four wheel steering and propulsion of the platform. The result is improved mobility which allows parallel displacement of the vehicle during turns by decoupling adjustments in position from adjustments in orientation. Control of the platform is provided through a vehicle electronics and control system based on embedded controllers and standard communication protocols. The software implements a hybrid deliberate software architecture that allows a hierarchical decomposition of the operation. The lowest level implements a reactive feedback control mechanism based on an extension of simple control for car-like vehicles to the four wheel case. The controller design forces the front and rear of the vehicle to follow a pre-determined path and allows the vehicle to maintain a fixed orientation relative to the path. The controller rationale is outlined and results from experiments in the field are presented. ?? 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Gammell2014,
abstract = {Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are popular in motion planning because they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s) extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also inconsistent with their single-query nature. For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that unless this subset is sampled directly, the probability of improving a solution becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this subset. The advantages of the presented sampling technique are demonstrated with a new algorithm, Informed RRT*. This method retains the same probabilistic guarantees on completeness and optimality as RRT* while improving the convergence rate and final solution quality. We present the algorithm as a simple modification to RRT* that could be further extended by more advanced path-planning algorithms. We show experimentally that it outperforms RRT* in rate of convergence, final solution cost, and ability to find difficult passages while demonstrating less dependence on the state dimension and range of the planning problem.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks and operations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widely demonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructured environments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, developments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, structures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performance measures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital for comparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisation and assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and to each task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic environments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low action success rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated into multi-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rate increased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems will enable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on each of these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Research needs to focus on the field use of autonomous or human–robot systems, the latter being a reasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should be suited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.},

To evaluate the control system of the prototype vehicle a path consisting of straight lines and left/right turns was constructed. The vehicle was able to follow this path with an error less than 0.3 m in turns and less than 0.2 m following straight lines. The prototype vehicle was constructed in a half year to gain experience with the control and navigation system; using these experiences a new prototype vehicle is under construction.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the economic feasibility of applying autonomous robotic vehicles compared to conventional systems in three different applications: robotic weeding in high value crops (particularly sugar beet), crop scouting in cereals and grass cutting on golf courses. The comparison was based on a systems analysis and an individual economic feasibility study for each of the three applications. The results showed that in all three scenarios, the robotic applications are more economically feasible than the conventional systems. The high cost of real time kinematics Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and the small capacity of the vehicles are the main parameters that increase the cost of the robotic systems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop an automatic guidance system capable of navigating an autonomous vehicle travelling between tree rows in a real-time application. The study focused solely on straight line recognition of the tree rows using a laser scanner as a navigation sensor. A 52 kW agricultural tractor was used as the platform on which the laser scanner was mounted. A Hough transform was used as the algorithm to recognise the tree row. An auto-regression method eliminated the white Gaussian noise in the laser scanner data. A calibration method was used to select the offset position of the laser scanner and to correct the heading and lateral error evaluation. An appropriate speed for tractor was also determined. By obtaining an accuracy of 0??11 m lateral error and 1??5 ?? heading error, it was possible to navigate the robot tractor autonomously between the orchard row crops. ?? 2006 IAgrE.},

Of the four, detection and identification of weeds under the wide range of conditions common to agricultural fields remains the greatest challenge. A few complete robotic weed control systems have demonstrated the potential of the technology in the field.

The robot employs two vision systems: one gray-level vision system that is able to recognize the row structure formed by the crops and to guide the robot along the rows and a second, color-based vision system that is able to identify a single crop among weed plants. This vision system controls a weeding-tool that removes the weed within the row of crops. The row-recognition system is based on a novel algorithm and has been tested extensively in outdoor field tests and proven to be able to guide the robot with an accuracy of +/-2 cm. It has been shown that color vision is feasible for single plant identification, i.e., discriminating between crops and weeds. The system as a whole has been verified, showing that the subsystems are able to work together effectively. A first trial in a greenhouse showed that the robot is able to manage weed control within a row of crops.},

One of the major efforts of this project is related with working in a natural, complex environment and the similarity between the weeds and the vegetable crop, which makes locating the weeds difficult. The robotic arm presents a parallel structure with six degrees of freedom, and due to its light structure, it is capable of reaching high accelerations. The end-effector has an electrode powered by a set of batteries and kills the weeds by producing an electrical discharge of 15 000 V. All the subsystems of the machine communicate through a controller area network (CAN) bus. There are two vision systems mounted on the machine. The first one is placed at the front of the robot to acquire and analyse field images, in order to detect weeds and send their coordinates to the robotic arm control. The second camera is placed close to the electrode, and its mission is to correct inertial perturbations by relocating every individual weed detected by the first vision system. The successful performance of this new concept of precise non-chemical weeding has been demonstrated in a lettuce crop in Valencia, Spain. (C) 2001 Silsoe Research Institute.},

abstract = {Electronics, software and sensor systems have become key technologies in agriculture. Future development steps are autonomous field robots with high technological challenges and options for economical and ecological benefits. The robustness of autonomous robots is considered to be of highest relevance for a step from present research activities towards prototypes. The application ‘crop scout' has been identified as a promising option to realise such a robot, called BoniRob, in an interdisciplinary cooperation with partners from electronic and agricultural industry as well as research institutions from engineering and agriculture. The vehicle is based on four wheel hub motors and hydraulic components, thereby offering a high flexibility with respect to navigation and changing height positions. Multi-sensor fusion - including complex sensor systems like spectral imaging and 3D time-of-flight cameras – and a RTK-DGPS system are applied for an individual plant phenotyping. The navigation concept of BoniRob is based on probabilistic robotics. A Gazebo-based 3D simulation environment for BoniRob is developed, including options for data and software exchange between the simulator and the real robot. In the first stage maize and wheat are considered for phenotyping, sensor and plant parameters have been defined according to the extended BBCH scale. As an additional option mapping of plant diseases based on spectral imaging information will be evaluated. The automatic phenotyping and mapping of all plants in a field will be a revolutionary change in the methods of field trials. Moreover, the availability of a robust crops scout platform will offer options for other field applications.},

It combines the exploration strength of the RRT algorithm that rapidly grow random trees toward unexplored regions of the space, with the efficiency of stochastic optimization methods that use transition tests to accept or to reject a new potential state. This planner also relies on the notion of minimal work path that gives a quantitative way to compare path costs. The method also integrates self tuning of a parameter controlling its exploratory behavior. It yields to solution paths that efficiently follow low cost valleys and the saddle points of the cost space. Simulation results show that the method can be applied to a large set of applications including terrain costmap motions or planning low cost motions for free flying or articulated robots.},

In citrus groves, where the tree canopy frequently blocks the satellite signals to the GPS receiver, an alternative method is required. This paper discusses the development of an autonomous guidance system for use in a citrus grove. The vehicle used for this study was a common tractor. Machine vision and laser radar (ladar) were individually used for guidance and a rotary encoder was used to provide feedback on the steering angle. A PID controller was developed to minimize the path error. The vehicle's guidance accuracy was tested in flexible test paths constructed of common hay bales. Path tracking performance was observed. The guidance system guided the tractor automatically through straight and curved paths. An average error of 2.8 cm using machine vision guidance and an average error of 2.5 cm using ladar guidance was observed, when the vehicle was tested in a curved path at a speed of 3.1 m/s. The guidance system successfully guided the vehicle in a citrus grove alleyway. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to establish the accuracy of an autonomous vehicle working in a field of transplanted cauliflowers. The main sensing systems, odometry and image analysis, are briefly described as is the control system which is based on a fusion of the two data sources using a Kalman filter. Experiments to establish accuracy are described. These were carried out on four plots of cauliflowers with varying degrees of disruption to the visual scene. The RMS error of vehicle lateral position control was 2- mm, while the RMS error of estimated vehicle position was about 10 mm. Little effect of the disruption on position control was observed. It is concluded that these accuracies would be sufficient to control a vehicle and an associated crop treatment device but that improvements to the vehicle controller would make the control of the treatment device easier.},

abstract = {One of the most important parts of an autonomous robot is to establish the path by which it should navigate in order to successfully achieve its goals. In the case of agricultural robotics, a procedure that determines this desired path can be useful. In this paper, a new virtual sensor is introduced in order to classify the elements of an orange grove. This proposed sensor will be based on a color CCD camera with auto iris lens which is in charge of doing the captures of the real environment and an ensemble of neural networks which processes the capture and differentiates each element of the image. Then, the Hough's transform and other operations will be applied in order to extract the desired path from the classification performed by the virtual sensory system. With this approach, the robotic system can correct its deviation with respect to the desired path. The results show that the sensory system properly classifies the elements of the grove and can set trajectory of the robot.},

abstract = {This paper covers the use of jointed manipulators in handling biological materials within the horticultural industry. Potential applications are reviewed by looking at previous research work and the scope for future development based on economic as well as technical considerations. It is concluded that applications with long seasons are the most viable, with flexibility of use between tasks an important consideration for applications with short seasons. A general specification highlighting the differences between horticultural and manufacturing industry requirements has been derived and some engineering proposals put forward to meet it. The use of computer vision is thought to be the best choice of primary sensor system. A geometrical layout which allows the manipulator to approach the target along a "line of sight" is favoured, as it simplifies collision avoidance in an unstructured environment and might allow recalibration of manipulator position during extension. Pneumatic actuators are thought to offer many advantages over electric or hydraulic drives provided that adequate dynamic control can be achieved. It is concluded that the generic differences in specification between industrial and horticultural manipulators provide an opportunity to take a new approach in manipulator design. In order to provide the analytical tools necessary for this new approach further research is needed in the interrelated areas of actuator choice, geometrical configuration and control strategy.},

abstract = {Applying robotics in plant production requires the integration of robot capabilities, plant culture, and the work environment. Commercial plant production requires certain cultural practices to be performed on the plants under certain environmental conditions. Some of the environmental conditions are mostly natural and some are modified or controlled. In many cases, the required cultural practices dictate the layout and materials how of the production system, Both the cultural and environmental factors significantly affect when, where and how the plants are manipulated. Several cultural practices are commonly known in the plant production industry. The ones which have been the subject of robotics research include division and transfer of plant materials in micropropagation, transplanting of seedlings, sticking of cuttings, grafting, pruning, and harvesting of fruit and vegetables. The plants are expected to change their shape and size during growth and development. Robotics technology includes many sub-topics including the manipulator mechanism and its control, end-effector design, sensing techniques, mobility, and workcell development. The robots which are to be used for performing plant cultural tasks must recognize and understand the physical properties of each unique object and must be able to work under various environmental conditions in fields or controlled environments. This article will present some considerations and examples of robotics development for plant production followed by a description of the key components of plant production robots. A case study on developing a harvesting robot for an up-side-down single truss tomato production system will also be described.},

Sensors include global positioning systems (GPS), machine vision, dead-reckoning sensors, laser-based sensors, inertial sensors and geomagnetic direction sensors. Computational methods for sensor information are used to extract features and fuse data. Planners generate movement information to supply control algorithms. Actuators transform guidance information into changes in position and direction. A number of prototype guidance systems have been developed but have not yet proceeded to commercialization.

The number of genes in one chromosome depends on the environment. The locations of the robot, the target and the obstacle are marked in the workplace. The proposed algorithm is capable of generating collision-free paths for a mobile robot in both static and dynamic environments. In a static environment, the generated robot path is optimal in the sense of the shortest distance. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by simulation studies.},

abstract = {The background to the development of a two-wheel drive agricultural gantry system, its assessment and evolution into a commercial machine are described. Details of the main frame, transmission, implement attachment linkages and vehicle control systems are discussed and their performance assessed. Soil and crop responses to gantry systems are presented. A minimum power-to-weight ratio of 15 Kw/t is recommended for adequate performance. To maintain vehicle stability, the ratio of the weight on the drive wheels to that on the undriven castor wheels should not exceed 75:25. Up to 70{\%} tillage energy savings can be made by removing all traffic from the cultivated area and plough resistance may be reduced by up to 50{\%}. Conventional traffic on the soil increases aggregate size and reduces porosity compared with zero traffic operations. The yield of spring barley in 1991 on a clay soil was increased by around 0{\textperiodcentered}75 t/ha under zero compared with conventional traffic, confirming a similar winter wheat yield response in 1990. It is concluded that suitably engineered gantries are able to carry out most operations on a farm and that they offer significant advantages over existing tractor systems in many aspects of their operation. The effect of improved boom stability on chemical applications needs to be quantified as well as the precise bout matching made possible by gantry systems.},

The only prior information required was to be the plant spacing, an approximate row length and the number of beds. To achieve this a small horticultural toolframe tractor was fitted with navigation and computer control equipment and an experimental marking device. A charged couple device (CCD) was located centrally at the front of the vehicle looking forward and down in order to provide images of crop rows. The images were analysed to provide guidance information. Signals from vehicle motion sensors (odometry and accelerometers) and a compass were combined with the image analysis data to provide vehicle control information that was robust to natural variability. A segmentation was performed using image intensity, size and geometric information to pick out crop plants requiring treatment. This information was passed to the treatment device controller which selected from an array of 27 solenoid valves to operate appropriate spray nozzles arranged transversely across the machine. Field trials of selective spray treatment of a young transplanted crop, conducted at a vehicle speed of 0{\textperiodcentered}7 m/s, showed that all plants were treated, though coverage of each plant was not perfect. Mean measured error along the row was 1 mm and lateral error 11 mm. The standard deviation in these errors were 26 and 20 mm, respectively. Only 8{\%} of the total area of the bed was covered with spray, thus showing a potentially large saving in agro-chemicals with environmental and economic advantages. The vehicle has been operated extensively in a wide variety of crops of different sizes and ground coverage, with good reliability under favourable lighting conditions.},

abstract = {Much research on automation in agriculture has been presented in recent years at the annual meetings of the Japanese Society of Agricultural Machinery (JSAM). This research has been performed in universities and government institutes, and by agricultural machinery manufacturers. Because of funding limitations, research in universities has concentrated on methodologies, such as navigation, sensing, and application of control theory. Development of a one dimensional image sensor, and application of neural networks and genetic algorithms, has taken place at Hokkaido University; vision guidance and fuzzy logic application at the University of Tokyo; an automatic follow-up vehicle has been developed at Kyoto University; and an automatic transport vehicle at Ehime University. At research institutes and manufacturers, with their greater financial freedom, more practical systems have been developed. A tilling robot and a driver-less air blast sprayer is being developed in the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institute (BRAIN); and an autonomous rice planter, a tillage robot and autonomous forage tractor in the research institute of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery (MAFF). Kubota Co. Ltd has developed autonomous rice planting and husbandry vehicles. In Asian countries an autonomous speed sprayer is under study in Korea and an autonomous power sprayer in Taiwan, but little research is performed elsewhere in Asia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Autonomous orchard vehicles have been shown to increase worker efficiency in tasks including pruning, thinning, tree maintenance, and pheromone placing. To cover entire blocks, they must be able to repeatedly exit an orchard row, turn, and enter the next. The authors' experience deploying autonomous vehicles for five years in commercial and research orchards shows that, when the map of the block is available, navigation errors decrease and the vehicle's probability of finding the next row increases. From a cost perspective, it is important that the map be built without expensive surveying equipment, and preferably using the same sensors used for vehicle guidance. Here, we present a landmark-based method that creates a local map of the block in which the vehicle operates using the laser scanner already present on the vehicle. We describe the mapping procedure and present results obtained in commercial orchards.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop an automatic guidance system capable of navigating an autonomous vehicle travelling between tree rows in a real-time application. The study focused solely on straight line recognition of the tree rows using a laser scanner as a navigation sensor. A 52 kW agricultural tractor was used as the platform on which the laser scanner was mounted. A Hough transform was used as the algorithm to recognise the tree row. An auto-regression method eliminated the white Gaussian noise in the laser scanner data. A calibration method was used to select the offset position of the laser scanner and to correct the heading and lateral error evaluation. An appropriate speed for tractor was also determined. By obtaining an accuracy of 0{\textperiodcentered}11 m lateral error and 1{\textperiodcentered}5 ° heading error, it was possible to navigate the robot tractor autonomously between the orchard row crops. {\textcopyright} 2006 IAgrE.},

abstract = {Automation of agricultural harvesting equipment in the near term appears both economically viable and technically feasible. This paper describes the Demeter system for automated harvesting. Demeter is a computer-controlled speedrowing machine, equipped with a pair of video cameras and a global positioning sensor for navigation. Demeter is capable of planning harvesting operations for an entire field, and then executing its plan by cutting crop rows, turning to cut successive rows, repositioning itself in the field, and detecting unexpected obstacles. In August of 1997, the Demeter system autonomously harvested 40 hectares (100 acres) of crop in a continuous run (excluding stops for refueling). During 1998, the Demeter system harvested in excess of 48.5 hectares (120 acres) of crop, cutting in a variety of fields.},

abstract = {Determination of a collision free path for a robot between start and goal positions through obstacles cluttered in a workspace is central to the design of an autonomous robot path planning. This paper presents an overview of autonomous mobile robot path planning focusing on algorithms that produce an optimal path for a robot to navigate in an environment. To complete the navigation task, the algorithms will read the map of the environment or workspace and subsequently attempts to create free paths for the robot to traverse in the workspace without colliding with objects and obstacles. Appropriate or correct and suitable algorithms will fulfill its function fast enough, that is, to find an optimal path for the robot to traverse in, even if there are a large number of obstacles cluttered in a complex environment. To achieve this, various approaches in the design of algorithms used to develop an ideal path planning system for autonomous mobile robots have been proposed by many researchers. Simulation and experimental results from previous research shows that algorithms play an important role to produce an optimal path (short, smooth and robust) for autonomous robot navigation and simultaneously it prove that appropriate algorithms can run fast enough to be used practically without time-consuming problem. This paper presents an overview and discusses the strength and weakness of path planning algorithms developed and used by previous and current researchers.},
