Systems for performing autonomous horticultural tasks usually require a means of locomotion through their environment. One approach is to directly integrate a drive system at the expense of increasing overall complexity and development risk. We present a generalised mobile platform designed to carry task specific robots through pergola style kiwifruit orchards. The platform is general in the sense that it itself does not perform tasks. It is intended solely to navigate through orchards and be capable of carrying robotic modules.
The selection of sensors best suited for autonomous navigation in this environment is discussed and presented with in-orchard test results. Details of the platform's software and hardware architecture are also discussed. The series-hybrid platform presented here has reliably self-navigated through two test orchards unassisted and is capable of carrying a 1000 kg payload.
