abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

@inproceedings{Zhang2013,
abstract = {Rows of trees such as in orchards, planted in straight parallel lines can provide navigation cues for autonomous machines that operate in between them. When the tree canopies are well managed, tree rows appear similar to corridor walls and a simple 2D sensing scheme suffices. However, when the tree canopies are three dimensional, or ground vegetation occludes tree trunks, it is necessary to use a three dimensional sensing mode. An additional complication in prolific canopies is that GPS is not reliable and hence is not suitable to register data from sensors onboard a traversing vehicle. Here, we present a method to register 3D data from a lidar sensor onboard a vehicle that must accurately determine its pose relative to the rows. We first register point cloud into a common reference frame and then determine the position of tree rows and trunks in the vicinity to determine the vehicle pose. Our method is tested online and with data from commercial orchards. Experimental results show that the accuracy is sufficient to enable accurate traversal between tree rows even when tree canopies do not approximate planar walls.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to tree recognition and localisation in orchard environments for tree-crop applications. The method builds on the natural structure of the orchard by first segmenting the data into individual trees using a Hidden Semi-Markov Model. Second, a descriptor for representing the characteristics of the trees is introduced, allowing a Hidden Markov Model based matching method to associate new observations with an existing map of the orchard. The localisation method is evaluated on a dataset collected in an almond orchard, showing good performance and robustness both to segmentation errors and measurement noise.},
